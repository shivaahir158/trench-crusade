[/INST] **Mission Objective:** Investigate the suspicious death of Cardinal Veritas and identify the responsible faction. **Operative:** Archivist Prime Lorn (Gothic Cardinalate). **Action Synopsis:** Archivist Prime Lorn successfully engaged Bishop Theron (Iron Hand ally) in a political and investigative standoff. Lorn skillfully surrendered the first piece of evidence (the silver quill) to prevent its immediate destruction, forcing Theron to secure it officially. Lorn then successfully steered the investigation to the Cardinal's bed-chamber, where they located a hidden confession—the **\"True Nature of the Iron Hand's Blasphemy.\"** This document revealed the Iron Hand's plot to use the **Obsidian Weave** to poison the sector's **Purified Water** supply for mind-control. When confronted, Lorn used the sheer, horrifying truth of the plot to **psychologically paralyze** Theron. Exploiting this shock, Lorn escaped and barred the office door, leaving the physical confession behind but successfully preserving the memorized, vital intelligence. **Status:** Operative is now on the run, carrying high-level intelligence regarding the Iron Hand's systemic plot against the entire Covenant.</s>"}
