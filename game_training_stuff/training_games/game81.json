{"text": "[SYSTEM: SCENARIO START: **The Tank-Splitter's Gambit**\n\n**Character:** **HAUPTMANN FREDERICA VON GOLTZ**, elite Prussian officer of the 6th Gardekorps. Heavily scarred, high mobility armor, \"tank-splitter\" orichalcum sword, and incendiary grenades.\n**Mission:** Lead a frontal assault to disable a high-value, newly deployed Heretic **Sacrilege Mortar Tank** that is currently shelling a Faithful defensive position.\n**Setting:** A muddy, shell-cratered field outside Königsberg. Visibility is poor due to fog and continuous explosions.\n**Initial Situation (Turn 1):** Von Goltz and her **Stoßtruppen** team have successfully closed the distance. The tank is 10 meters away, reloading its slow-firing Sacrilege Mortar. However, two elite **Heretic Legionnaires** (fast-moving capture specialists) have detached from the tank's sides and are waiting in the fog, ready to ambush the Gardekorps team.\n\nEND SCENARIO] <s>\n\n## Trench Crusade Adventure: The Tank-Splitter's Gambit\n\n**Narrator (Turn 1)**\nThe ground trembles under the weight of the Sacrilege Mortar Tank. Its previous shot has momentarily deafened you, but the slow reloading mechanism provides your window. You are 10 meters away, your **tank-splitter** sword gleaming, ready to fulfill the Prussian duty. But the air feels wrong—you sense the elite **Legionnaires**, the capture specialists, are already here. Speed is everything.\n\n**Your Turn (Hauptmann Action)**\nHow will Frederica von Goltz execute the lightning-fast attack while accounting for the ambush?\n\n1.  **Direct Tank Charge (Ignore Ambush):** Prioritize the objective. Charge the tank instantly, slicing the tracks with the **tank-splitter** before the Legionnaires can engage. Trust your unit's fire to suppress the Legionnaires. (Prioritizes speed, high risk of Stoßtruppen being captured/killed while covering).\n2.  **Legionnaire First (Split Focus):** Detonate one Incendiary Grenade between the two ambush positions, then immediately engage the Legionnaires with your sword to neutralize the capture threat before moving to the tank. (Prioritizes safety of unit/self, high risk of tank completing reload before you reach it).\n3.  **Smoke and Flank:** Throw a standard smoke grenade (if possessed) to blind the Legionnaires and the tank, then order the team to flank the tank's vulnerable rear engine compartment. (Prioritizes stealth, high risk of getting lost in the dense fog/smoke and losing precious seconds).\n\n[INST] I choose option 1, Direct Tank Charge (Ignore Ambush). I will scream, \"They can't capture a ghost!\" as I charge, and internally think about how much I hate mud. [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Turn 2)**\n[SYSTEM: [LORE CHECK: **Gardekorps Tactics (Speed over Safety)**: Charging the tank is the fastest path to mission success, but relies entirely on unit integrity. **Combat Inquiry**: The Legionnaires are specialized for capture and counter-attack. Player input accepted (Direct Tank Charge), action proceeds.] ]\n\nHauptmann von Goltz commits fully. She screams her defiance and sprints toward the tank's tracks, moving with impossible speed despite the heavy mud. Her team opens fire, attempting to suppress the ambush positions in the fog.\n\nThe **Heretic Legionnaires** are not surprised. As Von Goltz focuses on the tracks, the Legionnaires execute their counter-tactic: they do not try to kill her. They surge forward in a perfectly coordinated, non-lethal tackle.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **Critical Failure (Legionnaire Capture): 1/10** (The extreme focus on the tank causes the Hauptmann to miss the precise, non-lethal counter-tackle.)] ]\n\n**FAILURE CONDITION MET (ELITE CAPTURE)**: Von Goltz's concentration is entirely focused on the orichalcum blade meeting the tank track. She is so fixated on the precision of the strike that she fails to register the sudden, coordinated flank attack.\n\nThe two **Legionnaires** strike low, simultaneously. They use specialized, highly durable nets of consecrated chain (designed specifically to restrain high-speed, motorized targets) rather than blades. The impact is sudden and overwhelming. Von Goltz’s high-mobility armor allows her speed, but its reduced bulk offers little against a synchronized, non-lethal tackle. She is momentarily lifted, her sword falling harmlessly into the mud near the track, before being dragged into the fog.\n\n**Your Turn (Hauptmann Action)**\nYou are captured, wrapped tightly in the consecrated chain netting, completely immobilized, and being dragged away from the fighting by the two **Legionnaires**. Your **Stoßtruppen** team is still suppressing the ambush positions, unaware you have been neutralized. The tank is now just completing its reload.\n\n1.  **Incendiary Suicide:** Attempt to trigger one of the Incendiary Grenades concealed in your belt, hoping the explosion will kill the Legionnaires and possibly disable the tank, sacrificing yourself to ensure mission success. (Prioritizes objective, certain death).\n2.  **Command and Deny:** Scream a final command to your unit to **\"Abort! Retreat! Do not follow!\"** accepting your fate to save your unit from the same capture tactic. (Prioritizes unit survival/information denial, mission failure).\n3.  **Sacrilege Plea:** Scream a message to the tank crew, falsely claiming that your capture was a setup, and that the tank should fire the **Sacrilege Mortar** at your current position to destroy the Legionnaires as well. (Prioritizes desperate survival/chaos, extremely high risk of being executed by the tank).\n\n[INST] I choose option 2, Command and Deny. I will also scream, \"Tell my tailor I regret nothing!\" [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Final Resolution)**\nHauptmann von Goltz accepts the devastating failure of her speed-focused tactic. The shame of capture is secondary to the safety of her elite team. She strains her throat, projecting a final, clear command, followed by a personal, shouted epitaph.\n\nThe scream cuts through the fog: \"**Abort! Retreat! Do not follow! Tell my tailor I regret nothing!**\"\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **Success (Unit Survival): 8/10** (The command is heard and followed immediately.)] ]\n\n**MISSION FAILED (13/10).** The **Stoßtruppen** team hears the command—a clear, unambiguous denial of objective. Trained to prioritize the officer's safety and strategic coherence above all else, they instantly cease fire and retreat, disappearing into the fog. They escape the specialized capture tactic. \n\nThe **Sacrilege Mortar Tank** completes its reload, but its target has vanished. Hauptmann Von Goltz, the master of the tank-splitter, is dragged into the gloom, becoming a high-value prisoner for the Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent, a living testament to the dangers of the Heretics' specialized counter-tactics.\n\n### In-Lore Mission Report: The Tank-Splitter's Gambit\n\n**Mission Title:** Elimination of Sacrilege Mortar Tank\n**Character:** Hauptmann Frederica von Goltz (Prussian Gardekorps Officer).\n**Date:** Unknown, Königsberg Front.\n**Location:** Shell-cratered field.\n**Primary Objective:** Disable the Sacrilege Mortar Tank.\n**Secondary Objective:** Eliminate guarding Legionnaires.\n\n**Mission Summary:**\nVon Goltz chose the high-risk **Direct Tank Charge**, relying on speed to negate the hidden ambushers. This single-minded focus allowed the elite **Heretic Legionnaires** (capture specialists) to execute a perfectly coordinated, non-lethal counter-tackle using specialized netting. This led to a **Critical Failure (Legionnaire Capture)**. Von Goltz's final action, **Command and Deny**, was a **Success** in terms of unit preservation, as the Stoßtruppen retreated immediately, but ensured the primary objective's failure and the loss of the high-value officer.\n\n**Hidden Dice Roll Log:**\n* Turn 2 (Legionnaire Capture): **Critical Failure (1/10)**\n* Final Resolution (Unit Survival): **Success (8/10)**\n\n**Outcome:** **Mission Failure (High-Value Capture)**. The tank remains operational, and the elite officer is lost to the enemy.\n**Status:** **Hauptmann Von Goltz Captured, Tank Operational.** (Failure Count: 13/10)</s>"}
