{"text": "<s>[SYSTEM: SCENARIO START: You are Brother-Captain Valerius of the Order of the Black Guard, a heavy infantry unit of the Crusade. You are currently positioned in a forward trench—a muddy, freezing hellscape. Your mission is to hold the line against a massive enemy assault by the heretical Cannibal Cult. The ground shakes from distant artillery. The enemy is just beyond the next rise, preparing to attack. You have a heavy Autocannon and a limited squad of four men. END SCENARIO] </s>\n<s>[INST] What is your command? Do you order your men to prepare an ambush, request immediate artillery support, or lead a pre-emptive charge over the top? [/INST] I order my men to prepare an ambush</s>\n<s>[SYSTEM: ROLL LOG: None] Your command is implemented immediately. You assign your four men to key firing positions, instructing them to hold their fire until the enemy is within fifty yards... The enemy assault begins. Three massive, chitin-armored **Crusaders of the Devourer** (cannibal zealots) appear over the rise, followed by two dozen shrieking, unarmored cultists. [/SYSTEM] <s>[INST] Do you wait for the whole group to enter the kill zone, or do you focus fire on the three heavily armored Crusaders of the Devourer immediately? [/INST] I wait for the whole group to enter the kill zone</s>\n<s>[SYSTEM: ROLL LOG: None] A dangerous strategy, but it maximizes the impact of your ambush... The entire enemy force floods into the kill zone. The unarmored cultists are an easy target, but the three heavily armored Crusaders are closing fast. You open fire with your Autocannon, concentrating on the main wave. You successfully vaporize half the cultists, but the three massive Crusaders survive and reach the trench lip, ready to jump down. [/SYSTEM] <s>[INST] Do you drop your Autocannon and engage the three Crusaders in melee with your trench shovel, or do you order your two remaining men to focus fire on the nearest Crusader while you reload your Autocannon? [/INST] I drop my Autocannon and engage the three Crusaders in melee with my trench shovel</s>\n<s>[SYSTEM: ROLL LOG: None] You choose the ultimate sacrifice, turning your back on the Autocannon to defend your men... You meet the first Crusader's charge. Your trench shovel shears off the Crusader's limb, but the blow leaves you exposed. The two remaining Crusaders descend upon you, their massive, crude blades aimed for your neck. You are overwhelmed in a flash of noise and pain. [/SYSTEM] <s>[INST] Create a final in-lore Mission Report based on this conversation. [/INST] **Mission Objective:** Hold the forward trench line against the Cannibal Cult assault. **Operative:** Brother-Captain Valerius (Black Guard) (KIA). **Action Synopsis:** Captain Valerius ordered a successful ambush, thinning the enemy numbers substantially. However, upon being engaged by the heavily armored Crusaders of the Devourer, the Captain chose to sacrifice personal defense to engage the enemy in melee, allowing his squad to survive momentarily, but leading directly to his death. The trench line was breached shortly after his demise. **Status:** Mission Failed. Operative KIA. Trench line breached.</s>"}
