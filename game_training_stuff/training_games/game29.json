{"text": "[SYSTEM: SCENARIO START: THE BONE COMMUNION - Faction: Gothic Cardinalate (High Command). Character: Cardinal-General Vult. Objective: Consult the **Council of Saints** to determine the exact deployment zone for the last remaining Paladin. Asset: The Reliquary of **Saint Andrew the General**. Resources: Three young Tacticians (Prime, Secundus, Tertius). Setting: The Council Chamber, Rome, where the machines of the Synod hum and the air smells of ozone and incense. END SCENARIO]\n\nNarrator:\n\nThe chamber is sealed. The Reliquary of Saint Andrew\u2014a femur encased in gold and diamantine\u2014is slotted into the Synod's processor block. **Tactician Prime**, a boy of no more than sixteen, is strapped into the throne. The spinal cables hiss as they drill into his vertebrae. He screams once, then goes rigid.\n\nYou need the coordinates for the Hell-Gate. The connection initiates. The boy\u2019s hair begins to turn grey instantly\u2014the cost of the Saint\u2019s voice is one year of life per heartbeat. The signal is weak. The Saint is whispering, the data corrupted by static.\n\nYour Turn (Cardinal Action):\n\n1.  **Stabilize:** Lower the voltage to spare the Tactician, accepting a slower data stream and potential signal loss.\n2.  **Overclock:** Crank the spinal voltage to maximum. This will age the Tactician rapidly (likely fatal), but forces the Saint\u2019s voice through clearly.\n3.  **Support Link:** Plug in Tactician Secundus in parallel to share the load, preserving the lives of both but risking a neural sync-failure.\n\n[INST] 2 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 1**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Cruelty/Efficiency): 1d6. Result: 5 (Success). Outcome: Connection stabilized instantly; Tactician Prime ages 40 years in ten seconds.]\n\nYou choose **Overclock**. You signal the magos to bypass the safety limiters. The spinal cables glow cherry-red. Tactician Prime convulses violently against the restraints. In seconds, his skin wrinkles, spots appear on his hands, and his hair falls out in clumps. He is an old man now, rattling his last breaths.\n\nBut the data feed spikes to 100% clarity. The voice of **Saint Andrew** booms through the vox-casters, not as a whisper, but as a roar of command. \"THE VALE OF TEARS. SECTOR 7.\"\n\nHowever, the strength of the connection has acted as a beacon. The Lords of Hell notice the communion. The skies above Rome turn black as a spiritual counter-attack begins. A **Greater Demon of Falsehood** attempts to hijack the signal, manifesting as a viral code entering the Tactician's dying mind.\n\nYour Turn (Cardinal Action):\n\n1.  **Sever Link:** Pull the plug immediately to save the data obtained so far, though it is incomplete (Sector 7 is vast).\n2.  **Physical Purge:** Order the Swiss Guard to execute Tactician Prime immediately while the link is active, trapping the Demon in the dying brain while you extract the final coordinates.\n3.  **Exorcism Protocol:** divert power to the holy wards to banish the demon, risking the connection timing out.</s>\n\n[INST] 2 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 2**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Ruthlessness/Data Integrity): 1d6. Result: 6 (Critical Success). Outcome: Demon trapped and purged; Tactician Prime eliminated; precise coordinates extracted.]\n\nYou choose **Physical Purge**. You waste no time on prayer. You nod to the Swiss Guard captain. A single heavy bolter round obliterates Tactician Prime's skull. The demonic presence, caught mid-manifestation in the neural tissue, shatters with a psychic scream that cracks the viewing glass.\n\nThe sudden termination forces a \"data dump\" from the Synod machines. You have the specific coordinates within Sector 7. However, the connection is severed. You have the *where*, but you do not have the *what*. You need to know the specific threat level to outfit the Paladin correctly.\n\nYou have two Tacticians left. You order **Tactician Secundus** to the throne. The Reliquary is still hot.\n\nYour Turn (Cardinal Action):\n\n1.  **Standard Link:** Connect Secundus normally, preserving his lifespan for future council sessions.\n2.  **Deep Dive:** Connect Secundus and immediately inject \"The Tears of Lazarus\" (a potent combat stimulant), forcing a deep-tissue bond to rip the tactical data from the Saint immediately.\n3.  **Inspect Relic:** Pause to have the Scribes check the Relic for corruption, as the Demon's presence may have tainted the bone itself.</s>\n\n[INST] 2 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 3**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Aggression/Corruption): 1d6. Result: 1 (Catastrophic Failure). Outcome: The Stimulants work, but the Relic was compromised. Mite-Demons activate.]\n\nYou choose **Deep Dive**. You have no patience for safety checks. Tactician Secundus is strapped in and injected with the golden fluid. His eyes dilate, and he arches his back as the connection slams home.\n\nBut you failed to check the Relic. The spiritual attack in the previous turn masked a physical corruption. The Reliquary has been breached by **Mite-Demons**\u2014microscopic infernal parasites. Fueled by the stimulants in Secundus's blood, they swarm out of the gold casing.\n\nThey pour into Secundus's eyes and mouth, burrowing instantly into his central nervous system. He begins to laugh\u2014a wet, gurgling sound. The data screens turn red. The Mite-Demons are overwriting the Saint's tactical data with lies.\n\nYour Turn (Cardinal Action):\n\n1.  **Total Incineration:** Trigger the chamber's thermal cleansing system, burning Secundus and the Relic to ash to stop the infection (Mission Failure).\n2.  **Sacrificial Filter:** Plug in **Tactician Tertius** (the last youth) into the *output* end of Secundus, using the third boy as a \"human filter\" to scrub the Mite-Demons' lies from the data stream before they reach the console.\n3.  **Manual Extraction:** Enter the chamber yourself to smash the Reliquary, hoping to salvage the bone before the Mites consume it entirely.</s>\n\n[INST] 2 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 4**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Atrocity/Success): 1d6. Result: 5 (Success). Outcome: Data filtered successfully; both Tacticians suffer horrific deaths.]\n\nYou choose **Sacrificial Filter**. It is a monstrous calculation. You order the guards to forcibly connect **Tactician Tertius** to the secondary port on Secundus\u2019s spine.\n\nThe corruption flows from the infested Secundus into the screaming Tertius. Tertius acts as a biological firewall; his body twists and withers as it absorbs the Mite-Demons and the false data, catching the lies in his own dying synapses. On your screen, the data stream turns from red to green.\n\nThrough the filter of a dying boy, the pure voice of **Saint Andrew** clarifies one last time. \"THREAT: ARCH-DUKE OF THE FLIES. RESISTANCE: POISON/ACID. RECOMMENDATION: GOLGOTHIC FLAMERS.\"\n\nBoth Tacticians expire simultaneously\u2014Secundus hollowed out by parasites, Tertius burned out by the psychic filtration. The chamber is silent save for the hum of the cooling fans.\n\nYou have the location. You have the threat. You have the loadout. You expended three human lives, but the Paladin will succeed.\n\n[SYSTEM: NARRATIVE END]\n\n***\n\n## \u2705 In-Lore Mission Report: The Bone Communion\n\n### **Character & Faction:**\nCardinal-General Vult, Gothic Cardinalate.\n\n### **Objective:**\nConsult the **Council of Saints** for Paladin deployment data.\n\n### **Final Status:**\n**Mission Success (Optimal Data / 100% Asset Expenditure).**\n\n### **Summary of Action:**\nCardinal-General Vult employed extreme pragmatic measures. Tactician Prime was **Overclocked** to death to secure initial coordinates, then **Physically Purged** to prevent demonic possession. When the Relic proved compromised by Mite-Demons during the second phase, Vult utilized a **Sacrificial Filter** strategy, feeding the corruption into Tactician Tertius to distill the pure tactical data from the infested Tactician Secundus.\n\n### **Outcome:**\nAll three Tacticians are deceased. The Reliquary of Saint Andrew requires extensive purification. However, the Paladin has been deployed with perfect intelligence, virtually guaranteeing victory in the Inferno.\n\n### **Resource Note:**\nRequest immediate conscription of three new Tactician candidates from the orphanage.\n\n***\n"}
