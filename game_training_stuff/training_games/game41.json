"text": "<s>\n[INST]\n**Narrator (AI):** The cold mountain fog muffles all sound, forcing you to rely on your keen senses. You find the first sign: a fresh, muddy trail leading off the established path, marked by a small, torn piece of brightly colored cloth—a child’s ribbon. The trail leads into a small cluster of ancient, half-collapsed dolmens (stone tombs).\n\nAs you approach the dolmens, you hear low, guttural chanting and the faint, terrified whimpering of a child. You estimate there are at least three **Beast-Supplicants** inside. They are clearly focused on the ritual and have not set up sentries.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Arrow Ambush:** Take advantage of the fog and the Beast-Supplicants' distraction to fire a precise volley of three iron arrows into the center of the dolmens, aiming for a quick kill.\n2. **Flanking Melee:** Circle silently through the fog to the rear entrance of the dolmen, dropping your bow to engage them in close-quarters combat with your hunting knife (high risk, but silent).\n3. **Vocal Disruption:** Emit a sudden, terrifying hunting howl to draw the Beast-Supplicants out into the open fog, where your knowledge of the terrain gives you an advantage.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI don't trust the fog for an Arrow Ambush! What if they scatter? **Vocal Disruption** but then I'll rush in with my **hunting knife** right behind the howl! I want to be *fast* but *scary*. Also, can I try to **light the ribbon on fire** as a distraction before howling?\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** A chaotic, multi-step plan relies entirely on speed and psychological shock. You choose to combine a terrifying distraction with an immediate, silent follow-up attack.\n\nYou snatch up the small, torn ribbon and flick out your flint and steel. The thin material catches quickly, a tiny, bright orange ember in the deep gray fog. You toss the burning ribbon just to the side of the dolmen entrance.\n\nBefore the small flame can even begin to consume the silk, you cup your hands and release a sudden, bone-chilling **hunting howl**—a sound perfected in the deepest Irish wilds.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Psychological Shock/Vocal Disruption):** Rolled 8. **Result:** Critical Success. Total enemy panic.]]\n\nThe effect is instantaneous and total. The chanting inside the dolmen cuts off violently. A ragged figure—a **Beast-Supplicant** with elongated limbs and coarse fur—scrambles backward out of the entrance, staring wide-eyed at the burning ribbon and the source of the terrible sound.\n\nHe is momentarily paralyzed by fear and confusion. The other two supplicants are still hidden, but you hear frantic movement inside the stone tomb.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Execute Supplicant:** Rush forward and use your **hunting knife** to quickly and silently eliminate the first, paralyzed Supplicant.\n2. **Locate Child:** Ignore the stunned Supplicant and immediately dart past him to locate and secure the whimpering child inside the dolmen.\n3. **Bow Draw:** Step back into the fog and draw your longbow, preparing a close-range arrow for when the other two supplicants emerge.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nThe paralyzed one is an easy target, but the child is the priority. If I **Locate Child** first, I can use the child as a shield! No, that's not Fianna honor. **Execute Supplicant**! Then I'll grab the bow and fire ONE iron arrow, not three, into the dolmen, aiming at the general center where the chanting was. I only have six arrows!\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** The Beast must be put down before it can harm the innocent. You reject the dishonorable tactic and focus on eliminating the immediate threat.\n\nYou close the distance to the paralyzed **Beast-Supplicant** with silent speed. Your **hunting knife** finds the gap in his transformed neck and slices cleanly through the corrupted flesh. He drops instantly, making no sound beyond a choked gasp. One down.\n\nYou quickly retrieve your bow, nock one of the blessed **iron arrows**, and fire it at low velocity into the gap between the dolmen's stones, aiming for the spot where the whimpering was loudest.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Arrow Accuracy/Damage Check):** Rolled 45. **Result:** Success. One target incapacitated.]]\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Child Safety Check):** Rolled 97. **Result:** Success. Child is unharmed by arrow.]]\n\nA terrible, wet shriek erupts from inside the dolmen, followed by the clatter of bone and stone. Your arrow has struck one of the remaining supplicants, incapacitating them, but the child is still whimpering.\n\nA third **Beast-Supplicant**—larger, covered in matted brown fur, and carrying a crudely fashioned stone club—charges blindly out of the main entrance, enraged by the death of its kin.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Feint and Stab:** Sidestep the brute's charge, allowing it to pass, then stab it in the flank with your **hunting knife**.\n2. **Last Arrow:** Fire your final arrow at point-blank range into the charging Supplicant’s chest, hoping the blessing holds.\n3. **Retreat and Reload:** Jump back into the dense fog, reloading your longbow to gain distance and better aim against the large brute.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI need my arrows for the escape! The brute is close, but I'm faster! **Feint and Stab**! Let him feel the Fianna knife! I will stab him *twice* and then, without looking, I will throw my empty bow towards the *rear* of the dolmen to distract the wounded one!\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** You choose the savage, high-risk close combat that the Fianna are masters of. The brute's blind, club-swinging charge is slow, fueled by rage.\n\nYou let the creature lumber past you, dodging the club that scrapes harmlessly across the stone. You pivot and sink your **hunting knife** into its exposed flank, driving it deep between the ribs.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Knife Melee Damage Check - Stab 1):** Rolled 18. **Result:** Success. Deep wound, but not fatal.]]\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Knife Melee Damage Check - Stab 2):** Rolled 81. **Result:** Failure. Creature shrugs off the second stab.]]\n\nThe brute roars—a sound of pain mixed with feral fury—and whirls around, but it is too slow.\n\nYou execute the second part of your chaotic plan: you hurl your heavy, empty longbow blindly toward the rear entrance of the dolmen, hoping to confuse the wounded supplicant inside.\n\nThe large brute, wounded but still standing, is now blocking the entrance to the dolmen.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **The Grapple:** Drop the knife and attempt to **grapple** the large brute, aiming to throw it back into the dolmen to crush the wounded supplicant and create a path to the child.\n2. **Kneecap Strike:** Use the **hunting knife** to sever the tendons in the brute’s knee, ensuring it cannot stand or follow you.\n3. **Call for Reinforcements:** Use a specialized Fianna call—a high-pitched hawk shriek—to alert any distant patrols of your desperate situation.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI don't have time for prayers! I'm going to grab that cutter and melt my way out. 3!\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** You abandon the knife and embrace the primal fury of the Chewa warrior, relying on leverage and surprise. The brute is roaring, wounded, and unbalanced.\n\nYou duck under its renewed club swing and throw your weight against its center of mass, driving your shoulder into its gut. You don't try to lift the heavy creature—you simply steer its momentum toward the collapsed stones of the dolmen entrance.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Grapple/Leverage Check):** Rolled 5. **Result:** Critical Success. Perfect execution.]]\n\nThe **Beast-Supplicant** is launched backward with immense force. It hits the stone entrance *hard*, smashing into the dolmen structure and collapsing a weak section of the ceiling. There is a horrible sound of splintering rock and crunching bone, followed by silence. The brute, along with the previously wounded supplicant, is buried under the debris.\n\nThe path is clear. You rush through the newly opened gap. The farmer's child—a boy of perhaps six years—is huddled, terrified but physically unharmed, near a bloodied stone altar.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):\n(Final Turn - Outcome Decisive)**\n1. **Accept Aid:** Secure the child and move quickly toward the woods.\n2. **Demand Justice:** Search the rubble for the lost knife and bow.\n3. **Attempt to Convert:** Recite a quick Fianna prayer of thanks for the successful rescue.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\n1\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** The priority remains extraction. You scoop up the terrified but otherwise unharmed boy, securing him close to your chest. The silence of the destroyed dolmen is heavy, and the fog seems to be lifting, exposing the location.\n\nYou scramble out of the wreckage and begin the long, careful walk back toward the path leading to Cill Chainnigh.\n\n---\n\n##  In-Lore Mission Report: The Wicklow Dolmen\n\n### **Agent:** Maelgwn Mac Eochadha, Fianna Skirmisher, Éire Royal Guard.\n### **Target Objective:** Rescue the abducted child from the Path of the Beast coven.\n### **Operation Code:** 'Beast's Bane'\n### **Status:** **SUCCESS (CHILD SECURED / COVEN NEUTRALIZED)**\n\n**Summary:** Agent Mac Eochadha infiltrated the coven's lair (a dolmen) and used a combined tactical approach of psychological shock (Vocal Disruption) and extreme close-quarters combat. Three Beast-Supplicants were neutralized: one executed by knife, two crushed under the collapsed dolmen after a successful grapple maneuver. The child was recovered physically unharmed.\n\n**Agent Status & Cost:** Agent sustained minor wounds (razor wire/cuts) but is functional. The agent lost the **longbow** (empty) and **hunting knife** in the dolmen rubble during the final decisive action. Four of six iron arrows expended. Agent is proceeding with the rescued civilian.\n\n**Strategic Impact:** The operation confirms the effectiveness of the Fianna's independence in tracking and neutralizing scattered Heretic remnants, securing the royal periphery. The mission is officially a success, and the people are safer for the night.\n\n***\n\n"
