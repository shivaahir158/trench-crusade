Objective: Plant a seismic disruptor charge on the main support pylon of the **Black Guard**'s forward command fortress to destabilize their defenses before a full assault. Setting: The narrow, high-altitude walkways beneath the 'Steel Citadel.' END SCENARIO]\n\nNarrator:\n\nYou are suspended high above the smog line, moving across thin structural I-beams beneath the colossal **Black Guard** fortress. Vizier Assassin Zafra, your articulated limbs grip the cold metal. The objective, the main support pylon, is directly ahead. However, a patrol of three heavily armed **Black Guard Sentries** is currently conducting a slow sweep directly across the pylon. They are too far away for stealth alone to succeed. You must bypass or eliminate them.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Direct Engagement:** Use your integrated thermal repeater to eliminate the patrol quickly, risking an alarm.\n2.  **Cable Manipulation:** Use specialized cutting tools to sever a secondary maintenance cable above the patrol, creating a distraction or collapse.\n3.  **Wait and Observe:** Take cover beneath the walkway and wait for the slow-moving patrol to pass, delaying your crucial action.\n\n[INST] I choose to **Cable Manipulation** to create a distraction without exposing myself to their heavy fire. [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 1**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Sabotage/Distraction): 1d6. Result: 4 (Success with Complication). Outcome: The distraction works perfectly, but the resulting collapse creates a temporary barrier to the objective.]\n\nA calculated risk. You deploy a micro-cutter drone which silently attaches to and severs the heavy maintenance cable above the patrol. The cable snaps with a shriek, whipping wildly against the steel structure.\n\nThe three **Black Guard Sentries** react instantly, their attention diverted upward. They open fire on the swinging cable, believing it to be the source of an assault. The initial threat is bypassed.\n\nHowever, the sheer weight of the cable as it snaps and coils on the walkway creates a temporary, unstable barrier between you and the main support pylon. Worse, the commotion has awakened a nearby defensive weapon system: an automated twin-linked heavy bolter turret swivels on a distant ledge, its targeting lights sweeping the area.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Sprint Past:** Ignore the debris and the turret, sprinting across the obstacle and planting the charge.\n2.  **Suppressing Fire:** Engage the twin-linked turret with concentrated fire, hoping to disable its targeting or distract it.\n3.  **Debris Evasion:** Use your cutting tools to quickly cut a passage through the loose, coiled cable and re-establish a clear path.</s>\n\n[INST] I will choose **Debris Evasion**. I must not risk a turret lock-on or fail to reach the objective swiftly. [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 2**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Obstacle Clearance/Speed): 1d6. Result: 5 (Success). Outcome: Path cleared swiftly, securing the chance to plant the charge.]\n\nEfficiency is the Sultan's law. You quickly employ your articulated manipulators and specialized cutting gear to slice through the heavy maintenance cable. You clear a direct, functional path to the main support pylon in seconds, just as the twin-linked bolter turret locks its targeting reticule onto your general location.\n\nYou are now standing at the base of the massive support pylon. The air here vibrates with the raw energy of the fortress above. You must attach the seismic disruptor charge to a vital nexus point. You have a few crucial seconds before the turret begins its devastating attack run.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Plant Charge (High Risk):** Attach the charge to the largest, most obvious nexus point, guaranteeing maximum damage but maximizing your exposure time.\n2.  **Plant Charge (Low Risk):** Attach the charge to a smaller, shielded nexus point that requires less exposure time, but will result in lower overall damage to the fortress.\n3.  **Counter-Turret:** Before planting the charge, throw a plasma grenade at the turret's position to temporarily disable it. [/INST]\n\n[INST] I will choose **Plant Charge (Low Risk)**. My priority is placing the device and getting out, ensuring the plan remains viable. [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 3**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Placement/Evasion): 1d6. Result: 3 (Mixed Success/Injury). Outcome: Charge successfully placed and activated, but the turret opens fire, inflicting a wound.]\n\nPrudence guides the blade. You quickly locate a shielded, but accessible, nexus point near the pylon's base. You slap the seismic disruptor charge onto the metal and activate its timer. The device emits a faint, high-pitched whine. The objective is now secured.\n\nHowever, your attempt at minimal exposure fails. The twin-linked bolter turret opens fire. The heavy caliber shells tear through the air. You manage to dive behind a thick structural beam, but one of the shells strikes your lower leg, shredding the hydraulic pistons in your ankle joint.\n\nYou are wounded and temporarily unable to move, but the charge is counting down. The turret, satisfied with its successful hit, halts fire and resumes scanning. You hear the slow, rhythmic *clump, clump, clump* of the initial **Black Guard Sentries** patrol returning.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Remote Detonation:** Immediately activate the seismic charge's remote detonation sequence, sacrificing your ability to escape but guaranteeing the objective's fulfillment.\n2.  **Repair and Move:** Attempt an immediate, crude field repair on your damaged ankle to regain minimal mobility.\n3.  **Cloak and Hide:** Engage your limited-use optical cloak and hide among the shadows until the returning patrol passes.</s>\n\n[INST] I choose to **Repair and Move**. I must escape to report on the fortress's status after the blast. [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 4**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Repair/Stealth): 1d6. Result: 4 (Moderate Success). Outcome: Repair successful; minimal movement restored, allowing evasion.]\n\nSelf-preservation ensures mission continuity. Working with feverish speed, you apply quick-sealant and manually adjust the shredded hydraulic lines in your ankle. You regain minimal mobility, allowing you to shuffle and lean on the pylon for support. You are still badly wounded, but you can move.\n\nThe returning **Black Guard Sentries** patrol is now only 30 meters away. Their armor is undamaged, and their weapons are held at the ready. You cannot afford to engage them in your current state. The seismic charge timer is audible only to you.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Cripple Pylon:** Use your limited mobility to place a secondary, smaller plasma charge directly on the pylon's surface to cripple it as a distraction when the patrol approaches.\n2.  **Execute Sentries:** Use your thermal repeater to try and assassinate the three advancing sentries before they reach your position.\n3.  **Scramble Retreat:** Use your regained mobility to scramble along the walkways away from the pylon, relying on distance and darkness. [/INST]\n\n[INST] I choose **Scramble Retreat**. My priority is to survive and allow the seismic charge to do its work. [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 5**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Evasion/Timer): 1d6. Result: 6 (Critical Success). Outcome: Escape successful; the seismic charge detonates, confirming mission success.]\n\nThe Sultanate requires the report. Leaning heavily on the structural beams, you scramble away from the support pylon. Your shuffling movement is clumsy, but the **Black Guard Sentries** remain focused on the original disruption point near the coiled cable. They do not spot your movement in the deep shadows beneath the walkway.\n\nYou reach the corner of the structure and pull yourself onto an access ladder. As you begin your slow, painful descent, the seismic disruptor charge reaches zero.\n\nThe detonation is not massive, but it is precisely targeted. The main support pylon shudders violently, emitting a dull, internal groan. Crucial internal bracing is shattered. The massive **Steel Citadel** above lists several degrees, triggering massive internal alarms across the entire fortress.\n\nThe **Black Guard Sentries** are caught in the immediate chaos, screaming as the metal beneath them shifts and tears. Vizier Assassin Zafra, your mission is complete. You have successfully crippled the enemy's main defense and secured your own escape.\n\n[SYSTEM: SCENARIO END]\n\n***\n\n## \u2705 In-Lore Mission Report: The Sultan's Eye\n\n### **Character & Faction:**\nVizier Assassin Zafra, Iron Sultanate.\n\n### **Mission Objective:**\nPlant a seismic disruptor charge on the **Black Guard**'s main support pylon.\n\n### **Final Status:**\n**Mission Success (Operational Status: Wounded).**\n\n### **Summary of Action:**\nVizier Assassin Zafra successfully used **Cable Manipulation** to distract the initial patrol.
