{"text": "[SYSTEM: NARRATIVE START: THE GILDED LIES - Faction: Gothic Cardinalate (Internal Conflict). Character: Inquisitor Veridian (Internal Affairs). Objective: Obtain and publicize a ledger documenting the illicit sale of sacred relics by the Prophet Council to the **Iron Sultanate**. Setting: The heavily guarded Archive-Cathedral of Antioch. END NARRATIVE]\n\nNarrator:\n\nThe air in the **Archive-Cathedral** of **Antioch** is cold, smelling of ancient parchment and ozone. Inquisitor Veridian, your target is a hidden ledger that proves the **War Prophets** on the Holy Council are selling consecrated relics and weaponry\u2014your faction\u2019s holy heritage\u2014to the despised **Iron Sultanate** for profit. You are currently in the restricted Scriptoria. Ahead, the door to the Vault is sealed. Guarding the Vault is a single **Black Guard Praetorian**, a warrior whose loyalty is absolute, but specifically pledged to the corrupt **Prophet Varrus**'s personal guard detail, not the Cardinalate itself.\n\nYour Turn (Inquisitor Action):\n\n1.  **Direct Challenge:** Confront the Praetorian, attempting to use your Inquisitorial authority to demand passage.\n2.  **Bribe Attempt:** Offer the Praetorian a newly confiscated piece of Sultanate weaponry as a bribe for entry.\n3.  **Silent Takedown:** Use a stealth field and a low-frequency sonic pulse to attempt a non-lethal, non-alerting takedown of the Praetorian.\n\n[INST] 3 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Narrative Turn 1**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Stealth/Takedown): 1d6. Result: 2 (Minor Failure/Alert). Outcome: Takedown fails due to Praetorian's specialized auditory implants; the Praetorian is alerted but not incapacitated.]\n\nYou choose **Silent Takedown**. You initiate your armor's stealth field and slip into the Praetorian's blind spot. You deploy the sonic pulse, expecting the shock to temporarily seize his armor systems.\n\nThe attack fails. The **Black Guard Praetorian** is equipped with specialized auditory implants, purchased illicitly from Sultanate contacts (paid for with the relic sales, ironically). He detects the low-frequency pulse instantly. He spins, his massive shield already raised, blocking your subsequent physical strike. He does not engage the general alarm, instead opting to communicate silently with his corrupt master, **Prophet Varrus**. He wants to deal with the threat personally to keep the ledger sale secret.\n\nYou are exposed, and the Praetorian is now in an aggressive melee stance, his power mace ready.\n\nYour Turn (Inquisitor Action):\n\n1.  **Pistol Barrage:** Disengage to medium range and fire a full clip of bolter rounds into the Praetorian's shield and armor.\n2.  **Feigned Surrender:** Drop your weapons and declare your intent to defect to the Praetorian's master, Prophet Varrus, hoping to be led inside.\n3.  **Vault Door Blast:** Ignore the Praetorian and use a rapid-weld torch to attempt to melt the Vault door's locking mechanism.</s>\n\n[INST] 2 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Narrative Turn 2**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Deception/Trust): 1d6. Result: 5 (Success with Caveat). Outcome: Deception works; the Praetorian is suspicious but recognizes the utility of a captured Inquisitor.]\n\nThe rot runs deep. You choose **Feigned Surrender**. You drop your weapons and declare your intention to serve **Prophet Varrus**, stating you have valuable information on the Cardinalate's investigations.\n\nThe **Praetorian** is instantly suspicious but greedy for the reward his master will grant for a captured Inquisitor. He lowers his mace slightly. He signals the Vault door, which opens with a heavy *hiss*. He shoves you roughly inside the Vault. \n\nThe Vault is huge, filled with scrolls and ancient relics. He binds your hands with magnetic cuffs and signals the Prophet. \"Prophet Varrus is on his way. In the meantime, you will wait here.\" He gestures to a massive, unstable pillar nearby. The Praetorian then turns his back to guard the door from external threats. The ledger is visible on a desk across the room.\n\nYour Turn (Inquisitor Action):\n\n1.  **Attack Praetorian:** Use your strength to break the magnetic cuffs and attack the Praetorian's exposed back.\n2.  **Cause Collapse:** Shoulder-charge the unstable pillar, bringing the ruin down on the Praetorian and potentially the Vault.\n3.  **Retrieve Ledger:** Attempt to quietly shuffle across the room, retrieve the ledger, and hide it before the Prophet arrives.</s>\n\n[INST] 3 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Narrative Turn 3**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Stealth/Prophet Arrival): 1d6. Result: 3 (Mixed Success/Discovery). Outcome: Ledger retrieved, but the Prophet arrives immediately, blocking the exit.]\n\nYou choose **Retrieve Ledger**. Utilizing the distraction of the Praetorian's focus on the door, you subtly work at the magnetic cuffs. While the cuffs hold, the chain connecting them is long enough to grant you minimal movement. You shuffle quickly across the uneven floor and secure the heavy, leather-bound ledger.\n\nBefore you can hide it, the door opens fully. **War Prophet Varrus** enters, his ornate, gilded armor gleaming, flanked by two more **Black Guard Veterans**. He stops immediately, his eyes narrowing as he spots the ledger in your cuffed hands.\n\n\"Inquisitor Veridian,\" the Prophet sneers, his voice laced with the sanctified authority of the Council, \"Such clumsy inquisitiveness will not serve your ambition.\" He raises his staff, its crystal focus beginning to hum with raw, destructive psychic energy.\n\nYour Turn (Inquisitor Action):\n\n1.  **Throw Ledger:** Hurl the ledger at the Prophet's face as a distraction.\n2.  **Target Praetorian:** Yell at the Praetorian to execute the Prophet, appealing to his misplaced loyalty to the Cardinalate.\n3.  **Evade Psychic Blast:** Throw yourself behind the massive unstable pillar, using it as cover against the incoming psychic blast.</s>\n\n[INST] 3 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Narrative Turn 4**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Evasion/Counter): 1d6. Result: 4 (Success). Outcome: Psychic blast evaded; the Vault door is damaged, creating an escape route.]\n\nPrudence over zeal. You choose **Evade Psychic Blast**. You throw yourself behind the unstable pillar just as **Prophet Varrus** unleashes a terrifying wave of psychic energy.\n\nThe blast strikes the pillar, shattering the ancient stone and sending chunks flying. The force also hits the massive Vault door and the **Praetorian** guarding it. The Praetorian is instantly vaporized by the unintended psychic backlash, and the door's mechanisms are utterly ruined, jamming it halfway open.\n\nVarrus is momentarily shocked by his own catastrophic collateral damage. The two remaining **Veterans** move to flank your position. You have the ledger, and the Vault is now exposed to the external corridor.\n\nYour Turn (Inquisitor Action):\n\n1.  **Escape:** Sprint through the gap in the ruined Vault door into the archives, taking the ledger with you.\n2.  **Melee Varrus:** Break your cuffs and charge the Prophet, using the crumbling pillar to cover your advance.\n3.  **Broadcast Ledger:** Use your comms to frantically broadcast a coded snippet of the ledger's contents to the high council before attempting escape.</s>\n\n[INST] 3 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Narrative Turn 5**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Broadcast/Mission Success): 1d6. Result: 6 (Critical Success). Outcome: Broadcast successful; the Prophet is exposed, guaranteeing full political fallout.]\n\nJustice must be seen. You choose **Broadcast Ledger**. Using the psychic shock to mask your system activity, you override your damaged comms and transmit a critical, coded summary of the illegal sales documented in the ledger directly to the highest non-corrupt members of the Cardinalate. The revelation is immediate and damning.\n\n**Prophet Varrus** screams, realizing his destruction is certain, not just physical but political. The resulting shockwave of anger and panic from the Council is registered even by your distant comms. Varrus abandons all pretense of authority and unleashes a desperate, chaotic final psychic assault.\n\nYou have seconds before the inevitable final confrontation. The Veterans are still moving to flank you.\n\nYour Turn (Inquisitor Action):\n\n1.  **Concealed Retreat:** Use the smoke and debris to make a break for the now-open Vault door and escape.\n2.  **Execute Varrus:** Engage Varrus in a final, lethal confrontation, sacrificing your own survival to eliminate the source of the rot.\n3.  **Pillar Collapse:** Detonate a low charge on the massive, shattered pillar, triggering a full structural collapse to buy time.</s>\n\n[INST] 1 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Narrative Turn 6**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Evasion/Mission Success): 1d6. Result: 5 (Success). Outcome: Escape successful; the corruption is exposed, leading to a factional schism.]\n\nYour survival is necessary to testify. You choose **Concealed Retreat**. As Varrus unleashes his wild, terminal psychic blast\u2014which misses you entirely, detonating a massive reliquary on the far wall\u2014you sprint toward the gap in the Vault door.\n\nThe two **Veterans** are caught between their collapsing allegiance and the Prophet's rampage. You escape into the dusty, labyrinthine corridors of the Archives, the physical ledger secured and the evidence broadcast.\n\nMinutes later, the sounds of intense internal fighting echo from the Vault: the loyalist Cardinalate guard, alerted by your broadcast, are engaging Prophet Varrus and his remaining men. The schism has begun. You have successfully exposed the rot at the heart of the Holy Council, securing a great but painful victory for the true Cardinalate.\n\n[SYSTEM: NARRATIVE END]\n\n***\n\n## \u2705 In-Lore Mission Report: The Gilded Lies\n\n### **Character & Faction:**\nInquisitor Veridian, Gothic Cardinalate (Internal Affairs).\n\n### **Objective:**\nObtain and publicize a ledger documenting the illicit sale of relics to the **Iron Sultanate** by the **War Prophets**.\n\n### **Final Status:**\n**Mission Success (Political Schism Initiated, Evidence Secured).**\n\n### **Summary of Action:**\nInquisitor Veridian infiltrated the Vault by **Feigned Surrender**, bypassing a corrupt **Black Guard Praetorian**.
