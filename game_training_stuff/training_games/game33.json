"text": "<s>\n[INST]\n**Narrator (AI):** The air is thick with the metallic stench of blood and rendered fat. Cannibal Cultists—grotesquely mutated humans with bone armor and sharpened teeth—swarm the trench, but your heavy Maximilian armor holds firm. Your Men-At-Arms are huddled near your leg actuators.\n\n\"The Flesh-Forge is 50 meters ahead, Captain! In that collapsed pillbox!\" shouts Brother Tomas over the roar of your engines. \"But the trench is packed with hostiles! And Nicodemus says the fuel is critical!\"\n\nBrother Nicodemus confirms: *\"We need fuel, Captain. Now, or the Aegis stops in twenty minutes of continuous combat!\"*\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Flamethrower Purge:** Activate the 'Dragon's Breath' flamethrower and burn a path straight through the cultists to the mortar.\n2. **Conserve Fuel:** Engage the cultists with the 'Oathsworn' greatsword, conserving the fuel for the final push on the Flesh-Forge.\n3. **Emergency Refuel:** Order Nicodemus to attempt a risky, field emergency refuel from the backup canisters now, right in the middle of the trench.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\n2\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** Efficiency demands conservation. You throttle the mighty engines of *The Seraph's Aegis* down to minimal power. With a high-pitched whine, the 'Oathsworn' power greatsword flares to life. You bellow a litany of cleansing and charge into the massed ranks of the bone-clad Cultists, relying on the immense mass of your suit and the sword's raw killing power.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Melee Combat vs. Swarm):** Rolled 19. **Result:** Critical Success. Devastating effectiveness.]]\n\nThe result is carnage. Cultists are cleaved in half, crushed underfoot, or sent flying into the trench walls. The sheer speed and power of the power sword, even on minimal fuel, is overwhelming. You smash through the main wave, leaving a sickening trail of gore and broken bone. You are now 10 meters from the pillbox containing the Flesh-Forge mortar.\n\nHowever, a massive, armored **Cult Champion**—a towering figure covered in welded metal plates and a crown of human teeth—leaps from the pillbox entrance, wielding a heavy, meat-hook flail designed to catch and dismember armored troops. The Champion is between you and the mortar.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Engage with Greatsword:** Trade blows directly with the Cult Champion, relying on the strength of the Maximilian armor to endure.\n2. **Ignite the Flamethrower:** Unleash a concentrated burst of 'Dragon's Breath' on the Champion at point-blank range, risking fuel consumption.\n3. **Use the Suit's Weight:** Attempt a full-power charge and grapple with the Champion, crushing it against the pillbox wall.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI will use the suit's weight. It will be glorious to crush the foul beast. 3\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** *The Seraph's Aegis* was designed for this. You override all conservation protocols and flood the actuators with power. The suit roars to life, overheating warnings flashing rapidly. With a speed that belies its bulk, you lower your massive shoulder and initiate a full-power charge, aiming to pulp the Champion against the thick concrete of the pillbox.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Charge/Grapple vs. Champion):** Rolled 94. **Result:** Catastrophic Failure. Engine malfunction/Critical Overheat.]]\n\nThe Champion is surprisingly agile. It sidesteps the charge, and its heavy meat-hook flail swings wide, catching the primary radiator grille on the back of your suit. More critically, the sudden surge of power causes a catastrophic failure due to the existing low fuel/high heat warnings.\n\nA tremendous *CRACK* echoes from your engine housing. Red steam billows out, choking the trench. The suit lurches violently, the engines sputter, and **The Seraph's Aegis* instantly freezes**. You are immobile, standing only a few feet from the enraged, uninjured Cult Champion.\n\nBrother Tomas and Brother Nicodemus scream as the Champion turns its attention from your immobilized suit to your vulnerable support staff.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Emergency Purge (Flamethrower):** Attempt a desperation move: sacrifice the last remaining fuel to fire the 'Dragon's Breath' blind, hoping to hit the Champion and buy time.\n2. **Eject:** Initiate the emergency self-eject sequence from the Maximilian armor, abandoning the suit to save your life and join the Men-At-Arms.\n3. **Invoke the Saint:** Immediately begin the recitation of the forbidden Saint of Gears Litany in the hope of an impossible mechanical intervention.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\n3\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** Trapped inside a paralyzed, boiling metal coffin, you know neither conventional weapon nor flight will save your support staff from the Champion. You override every vocal restraint and broadcast the forbidden plea over the suit's external vox-caster, dedicating your machine, your mission, and your soul to the unpredictable intervention.\n\n*\"By the bones of the Nephilim! By the broken gears of grace! Come now, Butcher of the Trench, and save this machine! I offer the fuel! I offer the heat! I offer the metal! Save the Aegis!\"*\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d1d00 (Divine Intervention Check):** Rolled 1. **Result:** ABSOLUTE CRITICAL SUCCESS. Divine Intervention Triggered and Amplified.]]\n\nThe steam surrounding *The Seraph's Aegis* instantly turns into a torrent of sparkling gold flakes. The ground around the suit flashes with blinding white light.\n\nThe Cult Champion, mid-swing, stops its attack. It doesn't melt, but its heavy, welded armor plates begin to *vibrate* and fall off, revealing the raw, horrifying flesh beneath. The Champion collapses, screaming, as its own teeth and bones begin to aggressively grow outward, skewering itself.\n\nA silver death-masked presence coalesces near your engine housing. The **Butchered Saint** reaches out, not to your cockpit, but directly into the ruptured engine block. She ignores the scorching heat and manually manipulates the broken pistons and snapped lines.\n\nThen, she touches the flail that jammed your suit. The flail instantly disintegrates into a shower of harmless dust, and the damage to the radiator is reversed, replaced with new, shining brass components. The engines roar back to life, not at 30%, but at **100% capacity**. The overheating is gone.\n\nThe Saint vanishes as quickly as she appeared, leaving the fully-powered *Seraph's Aegis* ready for battle. Brother Tomas and Nicodemus stare in stunned silence at the newly purified engine and the convulsing Champion.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Destroy the Flesh-Forge:** End the attack immediately by incinerating the pillbox with the fully-fueled Dragon's Breath flamethrower.\n2. **Preach the Miracle:** Exit the suit and begin proselytizing the miracle to the surviving Men-At-Arms.\n3. **Continue Conservation:** Switch back to the greatsword and continue the fight, ignoring the supernatural assistance.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\n1\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** The mission comes first, regardless of the demonic or divine source of your power. You ignore the horror and the miracle, focusing on the tactical imperative. With a sound like a thousand angry hornets, the 'Dragon's Breath' flamethrower unleashes a torrent of purified, superheated promethium fuel.\n\nThe entire pillbox housing the 'Flesh-Forge' heavy mortar is engulfed in fire. Cultists inside shriek as they are reduced to ash and molten fat. The structure collapses instantly, silencing the mortar position.\n\nThe main Black Guard advance, seeing the sudden, spectacular success and the lack of mortar fire, surges forward, screaming war cries. Your task is complete.\n\nYou look down at your Men-At-Arms. They are terrified but safe. You are fueled, fixed, and victorious, powered by the impossible grace of the Butchered Saint.\n\n---\n\n## 📜 In-Lore Mission Report: The Maw Trench Purge\n\n### **Agent:** Brother-Captain Valens, Knight of the Aurelian Angelic Knights of Saint George (*The Seraph's Aegis*).\n### **Target Objective:** Clear the trench line and silence the Flesh-Forge mortar.\n### **Operation Code:** 'Nephilim’s Fury'\n### **Status:** **SUCCESS (MACHINE CORRUPTED / MAXIMAL EFFECTIVENESS)**\n\n**Summary:** Captain Valens successfully led the counter-attack, engaging the Cannibal Cult forces in melee. The mission was critically endangered by a catastrophic engine failure (fuel exhaustion/overheating) induced by a Cult Champion attack.\n\n**Divine/Heretical Intervention:** Facing certain destruction, Agent Valens invoked the forbidden Saint of Gears Litany. The Butchered Saint appeared, neutralized the Cult Champion through a violent process of anatomical acceleration, and instantaneously repaired and supercharged the Maximilian Suit's engine. *The Seraph's Aegis* is now operating at capabilities far exceeding its design limits.\n\n**Cost to Faith:** The mission was a resounding success, leading to the immediate destruction of the Flesh-Forge. However, the suit, *The Seraph's Aegis*, is now considered **Theologically Compromised/Possessed** by the Saint's essence. The fuel consumption is zero, the heat management is flawless, and the suit emits a faint scent of sandalwood. Agent Valens is to be held incommunicado with his machine, the suit is to be locked in full operational mode, and both are to be transferred to the Eastern Crusade Front where maximal combat output is required, regardless of the spiritual cost. The Knight is now considered an asset of Divine/Heresy-blessed war material.\n\n***\n\n"
