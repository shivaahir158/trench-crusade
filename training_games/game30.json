Objective: Defend the crucial rail bridge over the Tiber from the supplies-independent **Clockwork Legions** of Demon Eligos. Assets: One full squadron of Papal Air Force Fighters, two companies of Swiss Guard Heavy Mechanized Infantry. Setting: The northern defenses of the Papal States. END SCENARIO]\n\nNarrator:\n\nThe intel is confirmed: the vanguard of **Demon Eligos's** automaton army is less than a kilometer from the Tiber rail bridge, your last intact supply route. Their relentless, supplies-independent nature makes them a grinding threat. Your **Heavy Mechanized Infantry** is still 15 minutes away, moving at its maximum speed. Your **Papal Air Force** is ready, but satellite intel shows the automatons have deployed heavy, occult anti-air batteries.\n\nYour Turn (Cardinal Action):\n\n1.  **Air Denial:** Launch the Papal Air Force immediately on a low-altitude strike to annihilate the vanguard before they reach the bridge.\n2.  **Delayed Defense:** Set demolition charges on the bridge and pull back to wait for the Mechanized Infantry to arrive for a strong defensive line.\n3.  **War Indulgences:** Signal the Synod to initiate a costly **War Indulgence** salvo\u2014a massive, but delayed, holy artillery strike on the main advance route.\n\n[INST] We can't let them take that bridge. Launch the air strike NOW. They need to feel the fury of the Faithful from the sky. No delays! [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 1**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Air Strike/Risk): 1d6. Result: 3 (Mixed Success/Asset Damage). Outcome: Vanguard eliminated, but air support takes critical losses.]\n\nYou choose **Air Denial**. You ignore the risk and order a full air deployment. The Papal Air Force screams over the battlefield. The vanguard of Eligos's automatons is indeed vaporized by the blessed plasma fire. A necessary, crushing blow.\n\nHowever, the enemy's anti-air batteries, powered by demonic contracts, were positioned perfectly. They shred three of your six fighter jets in the first pass. Your air superiority is now marginal and heavily compromised.\n\nSimultaneously, the main automaton wave\u2014hundreds of relentless, emotionless war machines\u2014reaches the bridge and begins to cross. Your **Heavy Mechanized Infantry** arrives, forming a line, but the automatons do not stop, they do not flinch, and they do not slow down.\n\nYour Turn (Cardinal Action):\n\n1.  **Full Mechanized Attack:** Order the Mechanized Infantry to charge across the bridge and engage the automatons in a direct, decisive counter-assault.\n2.  **Bridge Demolition:** Detonate the demolition charges on the bridge now, isolating the mechanized units on the near bank, sacrificing the bridge to halt the wave.\n3.  **Air Recon:** Use the remaining three air units for high-altitude reconnaissance to pinpoint the anti-air batteries before they can be used again.</s>\n\n[INST] The bridge is the key. They *must* be stopped now. Tell the Mechanized Captain: Full forward! Drive those soulless machines back into the river! Domenico Alidosi expects victory! [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 2**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Aggression/Attrition): 1d6. Result: 2 (Minor Failure/High Casualties). Outcome: Bridge held, but Mechanized Infantry suffers immense attrition due to the enemy's supplies-independence.]\n\nYou choose **Full Mechanized Attack**. You broadcast your order, invoking your family name. Your elite **Swiss Guard Mechanized Infantry**\u2014armed with heavy plasma cannons\u2014thunders onto the bridge, meeting the automaton wave head-on.\n\nThis is not a battle; it is a grind. The mechanized units are powerful, but the automatons, needing no rest, supplies, or morale, simply absorb the damage. Where a living soldier would break, the clockwork continues. Two Mechanized companies are nearly shattered. The automatons are halted at the bridge midpoint, but the cost is staggering. The Faithful hold the bridge, but their best ground asset is critically broken.\n\nThe initial threat is contained, but one detachment of **Clockwork Sappers**\u2014nimble, explosive units\u2014was missed in the chaos. They are now flanking the main battle line, moving along the riverbank toward the undefended rail yard, where your war supplies are stored.\n\nYour Turn (Cardinal Action):\n\n1.  **Personal Charge:** Disembark and rally the remaining Heavy Mechanized forces for a desperate, final charge against the sappers.\n2.  **Emergency Air Strike:** Deploy your last three fighter jets for a suicidal low-altitude precision strike on the sapper detachment.\n3.  **Sacrifice Supplies:** Order the rail yard to be evacuated and subsequently scorched by nearby standard Swiss Guard, destroying the supplies to deny them to the enemy.</s>\n\n[INST] I am a War Cardinal. I don't give up ground or supplies. Scorch the earth? Never. Get the last three pilots on the line. Tell them Alidosi demands a clean pass. Put everything into that final strike, no matter the cost. We will smash those sappers from the sky! [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 3**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Desperation/Final Effort): 1d6. Result: 5 (Success). Outcome: Flanking threat annihilated; supply depot secured, but all air assets are lost.]\n\nYou choose **Emergency Air Strike**. You push your pilots beyond reason. The three remaining Papal Air Force jets execute a near-impossible low-altitude run over the rail yard. The **Clockwork Sappers** are completely destroyed by the precision ordnance before they can reach the depot.\n\nHowever, the enemy's anti-air batteries, already zeroed in, fire their final, spiteful volley. The last three jets are torn apart and crash into the fields outside the depot. You have secured the rail bridge and the supplies, but the **Papal Air Force** is annihilated. Your **Heavy Mechanized Infantry** is reduced to wreckage, and the **Clockwork Legions** are repulsed, but still present on the battlefield.\n\nWar Cardinal Domenico Alidosi, you have achieved victory through sheer aggressive expenditure of every asset at your disposal. The line holds, but the cost to the defense of the Papal States is nearly irreparable.\n\n[SYSTEM: NARRATIVE END]\n\n***\n\n## \u2705 In-Lore Mission Report: The Iron Vanguard\n\n### **Character & Faction:**\nWar Cardinal Domenico Alidosi, Gothic Cardinalate (Papal States).\n\n### **Objective:**\nHalt a major advance by Demon Eligos's Clockwork Legions and defend the Tiber rail bridge.\n\n### **Final Status:**\n**Mission Success (Bridge Secured, Assets Destroyed).**\n\n### **Summary of Action:**\nCardinal Alidosi utilized an aggressively high-risk strategy, prioritizing immediate engagement over safety. He ordered an immediate **Air Denial** strike despite anti-air risks (costing 50% of the air force). He followed this with a **Full Mechanized Attack** that successfully halted the main automaton wave but crippled his ground elite. Finally, he gambled and won with a final **Emergency Air Strike**, expending his last three jets to destroy the flanking **Clockwork Sappers** and save the supply depot.\n\n### **Outcome:**\nThe Tiber rail bridge and the northern supply lines are safe. The advance of Demon Eligos has been halted. However, the Papal Air Force is functionally eliminated, and the Heavy Mechanized Infantry requires complete refurbishment. The Cardinal's dream of retaking Venice is now severely delayed by the necessity of replacing these lost assets.\n\n### **Strategic Note:**\nAlidosi's aggressive command saved the supplies but proved the immense, grinding cost of engaging the supplies-independent automaton legions. The Church's coffers will be severely strained by this \"victory.\"\n\n***\n"}
