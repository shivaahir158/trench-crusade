"text": "<s>\n[INST]\n**Narrator (AI):** The small, above-ground chapel is fouled with fly effigies and thick, sweet-smelling incense wafting from crude censers. The air makes your head swim, despite your mask. Brother Mateo clutches his torch, swaying slightly. Sister Helena whispers: *\"Agnese, I hear the music. It sounds like Mama's lullaby...\"*\n\nYou identify the subtle trap: a trio of Cult Thralls—recent converts, still wearing rags—carrying crude obsidian knives, positioned silently just inside the narrow, descending stairwell leading to the underground. They are clearly waiting to ambush the first person to enter.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n* **Burn the Entry:** Use a single, sustained burst of the **Hand-Flamer** into the stairwell to clear the Thralls and purify the air (one fuel canister used).\n* **Melee Breach:** Order Brother Mateo and Sister Helena to charge the stairwell with their torches, acting as bait while you follow with the Crucifix-Axe.\n* **Tempt Fate:** Hold your position, use your Crucifix-Axe to smash the censers inside the chapel to stop the flow of incense, risking the Thralls charging *up* the stairs.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI need my fuel for the pockets. I will smash the censers with the Crucifix-Axe and then charge the stairwell myself! I need the Thralls to be in disarray, and my brethren need the air cleared. Also, tell Mateo and Helena to hold the line until I give the command.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** A brave, high-risk choice, Sister. You move rapidly, slamming the consecrated steel **Crucifix-Axe** into the nearest crude altar, shattering the censers and spilling the foul, smoking incense onto the ground. The sudden lack of fresh hallucinogen is jarring, but the air is not instantly clear.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Sledgehammer/Distraction Check):** Rolled 49. **Result:** Success. Thralls are momentarily confused by the noise/smoke shift.]]\n\nThe Thralls, disoriented by the abrupt change in atmospheric conditions, begin to twitch and moan. You see your window and bellow: *\"For the Blessed Mother! Charge!\"*\n\nYou leap onto the narrow, slippery stone steps, the heavy Crucifix-Axe leading the way. The first Thrall recovers just as you reach him.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Melee Combat vs. Thralls):** Rolled 7. **Result:** Critical Success. Devastating clean strike.]]\n\nThe Crucifix-Axe splits the first Thrall from shoulder to belt, sending him tumbling down the stairs. The second Thrall attacks wildly with its obsidian knife, but your handcrafted armor holds. You shove your shoulder into the third Thrall, knocking him off the stairs and into the dark well of the complex. The stairwell is clear, but the fall of the last Thrall alerts the deeper temple denizens.\n\nBrother Mateo and Sister Helena rush down behind you. You are now in the maze of dark tunnels. Your Men are still slightly disoriented (one turn remaining).\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n* **Follow the Noise:** Charge immediately toward the sound of manic chanting and grotesque music, believing the fermenting pockets will be nearby (high risk/fast route).\n* **Use the Axe as a Beacon:** Instruct Mateo and Helena to hold the position while you move cautiously through the maze, marking the turns with the Crucifix-Axe's hilt.\n* **Divine Fire:** Use a short burst of the **Hand-Flamer** to purify the air ahead, clearing fumes and scaring off any lurking Thralls.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI need to keep my Men safe, and I need that fuel. I will instruct Mateo and Helena to remain at the stairwell and hold that position. I will cautiously move forward using the **Axe as a Beacon** to mark my path and look for the pockets, then signal them to join me. I will not follow the noise; Beelzebub's followers are known for their deadly lures.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** Prudence is a virtue in the face of demonic deception. You order your Flame-Bearers: *\"Hold the passage, brethren! Trust the steel, not the music! I will return.\"*\n\nYou leave the disoriented but obedient pair at the base of the stairs. You ignite a small, concealed lamp on your shoulder and begin your descent into the cold, damp stone maze. The air is slightly cleaner here, but the heavy, sickeningly sweet stench of rot and fermentation is growing strong—you know you are close to the target.\n\nYou come to a corridor lined with crude scriptoriums where Grail Thralls are frantically copying the Gospel of the Fly. Just beyond them, you see a faint, sickly-green light emanating from a heavy iron door. This is likely the laboratory or the fermenting pockets.\n\nSuddenly, a **Plague Almoner**—a robed, bloated, and hideous cult priest with a proboscis mouthpart—emerges from a side passage. It sees you and immediately raises a wickedly barbed staff.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n* **Shotgun Blast:** Use a short burst of the **Hand-Flamer** on the Almoner before he can raise the alarm (one fuel canister used).\n* **Ritual Duel:** Engage the Almoner in close combat with the **Crucifix-Axe**, relying on consecrated steel against the corrupted priest.\n* **Retreat and Call:** Retreat back to your Men-At-Arms, ordering them to advance and assist in the attack.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI have to avoid the alarm. A **Ritual Duel** is the only way to silence this monster without fire or noise. I will rely on the consecrated steel! I am Sister Agnese! I will show him the meek salvation of the Faithful is still stronger than his rotting splendor!\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** Your faith is your shield. You reject the easy, loud path of the flamer. You plant your feet and raise the heavy **Crucifix-Axe**, letting out a low, challenging roar. The Almoner hisses, dropping its barbed staff and rushing you with surprising speed, proboscis extended like a drill.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Melee Duel Check):** Rolled 1. **Result:** ABSOLUTE CRITICAL SUCCESS. Divine Judgement.]]\n\nThe moment the Almoner closes the distance, a brilliant, painful-to-look-at white light bursts from the consecrated steel of your **Crucifix-Axe**. It is not you striking the blow, but the grace of the Mother's Light.\n\nThe energy flows instantly from the weapon into the Almoner's corrupt form. The Almoner doesn't just die; it **purifies**. Its flesh and proboscis violently crystallize, turning into harmless, sparkling dust. The thick, foul stench is replaced by the smell of ozone and burning herbs. The dust settles around your feet, and the threat is neutralized silently.\n\nYou are untouched. The door to the sickly-green light is open. You see two vast, steaming vats of thick, Black Grail-infected sludge—the fermenting pockets. One canister of fuel is enough to burn them both.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n* **Purge with Fire:** Use the **Hand-Flamer** to completely incinerate the fermenting pockets (one fuel canister used).\n* **Set Traps:** Use the remaining Almoner dust to contaminate the vats, trusting the Saint's light to poison the Black Grail (conserve fuel).\n* **Search for Artifacts:** Ignore the vats for a moment and search the side passages for gold or artifacts to fund the Procession's war effort.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nThe mission is to cripple the potency, and fire is the only certain way. I will **Purge with Fire**! Then, I will signal my Men, and we will get out of this infested hole.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** Certainty must prevail. You ignore the allure of treasure and the risk of a secondary chemical reaction. You unshoulder the consecrated **Hand-Flamer**.\n\nYou hold the trigger down, unleashing a twin stream of cleansing fire into the vats. The sludge instantly reacts, boiling over and sending up clouds of thick, black smoke. The sound is a wet, furious hiss. The vats melt, and the infectious Black Grail potency is consumed by the holy flames.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Target Destruction Check):** Rolled 2. **Result:** Critical Success. Total Destruction.]]\n\nThe entire fermenting complex is destroyed. You have two fuel canisters remaining.\n\nYou return to the stairwell, retrieve Brother Mateo and Sister Helena (now fully recovered), and begin your ascent back to the surface. The temple will be a dangerous, enraged hive for hours, but the local Cult is crippled.\n\n**Final Outcome:** Mission successful. The potent strain of the Black Grail used in the local missionary effort has been destroyed, and the core team escaped unharmed.\n\n---\n\n## 📜 In-Lore Mission Report: The Almoner's Downfall\n\n### **Agent:** Sister Agnese, Flame-Bearer of the Marian Procession.\n### **Target Objective:** Locate and destroy the Black Grail's 'fermenting pockets' in the Temple of the Fly.\n### **Operation Code:** 'Crucifix Light'\n### **Status:** **SUCCESS (CORE TARGET NEUTRALIZED)**\n\n**Summary:** Sister Agnese successfully infiltrated the Temple of the Fly. Displaying strong tactical awareness, she prioritized removing the hallucinogenic incense by destroying the censers, thus protecting her Men-At-Arms. Confronted by a Plague Almoner, she declined to use fuel and instead engaged in a ritualistic duel, resulting in a display of divine power.\n\n**Divine Intervention:** During the duel, the consecrated **Crucifix-Axe** manifested a powerful, cleansing Marian Light, instantly purifying the Almoner. This spiritual endorsement confirms the sacred nature of the Procession's war.\n\n**Cost to Cult:** Total destruction of the two primary fermenting pockets, severely crippling the local missionary effort and Black Grail potency. The psychological impact of the silent, crystalline purification of the Almoner will likely spread fear among the local Thralls.\n\n**Recommendation:** Sister Agnese is to be commended for her valor and spiritual purity. The **Crucifix-Axe** is to be immediately returned to the Holy Forge for further consecration, as it is clearly capable of channeling powerful divine energy. The Marian Procession has dealt a significant blow to Beelzebub's spiritual campaign in the hinterlands of Avignon.\n\n***\n\n"
