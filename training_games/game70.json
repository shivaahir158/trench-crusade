{"text": "[SYSTEM: SCENARIO START: **The Buzzing Harbingers**\n\n**Character:** **PIT LOCUST 'APOLLYON'**, a feral, powerful individual locust operating at the vanguard of a small swarm (10 total Locusts). Apollyon possesses immense speed and bloodlust.\n\n**Setting:** A large, open, but fog-filled **French Supply Depot** containing vital ammunition and food stores. The depot is defended by a detachment of 5 **French Engineers** equipped with three specialized **Flamethrowers** (designed for close-quarters anti-swarm defense).\n\n**Initial Situation (Turn 1):** Apollyon and the swarm burst out of the smoke pall 80 meters from the supply depot. The French Engineers immediately activate the Flamethrowers, sending arcs of fire sweeping across the ground, preparing for the assault. The mission is to destroy the supplies and scatter the defenders.\n\nEND SCENARIO] <s>\n\n## Trench Crusade Adventure: The Buzzing Harbingers\n\n**Narrator (Turn 1)**\nThe familiar smoke and the buzzing of your brethren fill the air—the heralds of doom. Below, the pathetic mortals have anticipated a fiery assault, bringing their own inferno. Their **Flamethrowers** are a serious threat to the swarm's low-altitude attack vectors. Your bloodlust demands immediate destruction, but a frontal assault will be costly. You must neutralize the fire threat first to allow the swarm to ravage the supplies.\n\n**Your Turn (Pit Locust Action)**\nHow will Apollyon and the swarm proceed against the fire defense?\n\n1.  **High-Speed Feint:** Apollyon performs a dizzying, sonic-speed flight pattern to draw the concentrated Flamethrower fire away from the swarm's main vector, allowing the other Locusts to flank the depot. (Prioritizes distraction and swarm preservation).\n2.  **Concentrated Dive:** Order the entire swarm to converge on the nearest Flamethrower operator, relying on sheer mass and feral momentum to overwhelm the soldier before he can fully deploy the fire. (Prioritizes eliminating the immediate threat, high risk of mass casualties from fire).\n3.  **Smoke Screen Amplification:** Use the powerful beating of your wings to kick up loose earth and ash, amplifying the fog/smoke pall into a blinding dust cloud to mask the swarm's advance. (Prioritizes concealment and closing the distance).\n\n[INST] I choose option 2, Concentrated Dive. As the swarm dives, I will command the swarm to sing a high-pitched, mocking version of a famous maritime shanty. I will then command Apollyon to steal the nearest Engineer's helmet and wear it as a novelty hat. [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Turn 2)**\n[SYSTEM: [LORE CHECK: **Swarm Tactics/Bloodlust (Feral Aggression)**: The Pit Locusts' primary impulse is overwhelming, brutal force. **Combat Inquiry**: Direct assault on a fire-wielding threat is extremely dangerous. Player input accepted (Concentrated Dive), action proceeds.] ]\n\nDriven by feral bloodlust, Apollyon leads the swarm in a screaming, high-speed dive toward the closest **Flamethrower** operator. The air is ripped apart by the sound of chariots as the creatures descend. The mocking, high-pitched shanty is an auditory assault, but the Engineers ignore the chaos, their eyes fixed on the incoming threat.\n\nThe French operator, trained for anti-swarm defense, holds his nerve. As the mass of demonic insects closes to 20 meters, he unleashes a searing torrent of ignited fuel.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **Critical Failure (Anti-Swarm Defense): 1/10** (The enemy technology is perfectly deployed against the chosen tactic.)] ]\n\nThe concentrated dive is a catastrophic error against the focused fire. The high-pressure, broad arc of flame engulfs the tightly packed swarm. The fire does not merely burn the creatures; it ignites the volatile residue on their ancient shells and melts the chitinous wings.\n\n**FAILURE CONDITION MET (SWARM DESTRUCTION)**: The concentrated fire instantly kills 5 members of the swarm, whose bodies drop smoking to the ground. Apollyon survives, but his wings are severely scorched, and his feral cunning is momentarily replaced by panicked pain.\n\nThe immediate objective (neutralizing the fire threat) has failed, and the swarm is decimated. The remaining Engineers, seeing the success of their defense, now sweep the remaining two Flamethrowers toward Apollyon.\n\n**Your Turn (Pit Locust Action)**\nYou are severely damaged and alone with 4 remaining swarm members. Two more Flamethrowers are sweeping toward your position. Your mission is irrevocably compromised. You must now save the remaining swarm or be completely destroyed.\n\n1.  **Desperate Retreat:** Order a full, immediate aerial retreat back into the smoke pall before the second wave of fire engulfs the remaining swarm members. (Prioritizes survival over objective).\n2.  **Kamikaze Counterattack:** Order the remaining 4 swarm members to perform a final, futile concentrated dive on the nearest Flamethrower operator while you attempt to fly high and escape. (Prioritizes partial destruction at total loss).\n3.  **Low Crawl:** Land and attempt to frantically burrow into the mud and ash, hoping to escape the sweeping fire. (Prioritizes individual survival, but dooms the objective).\n\n[INST] I choose option 1, Desperate Retreat. As I retreat, I will attempt to communicate to the Engineers, \"You have ruined my appetite for human flesh,\" and command the 4 remaining swarm members to collect all the spoons they can find as they leave. [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Final Resolution)**\nSurvival instinct, amplified by the terror of the flames, overrides the bloodlust.\n\nApollyon screams a high-pitched order. The 4 remaining Pit Locusts, scorched and terrified, attempt to gather utensils as commanded, but the relentless sweep of the twin **Flamethrowers** leaves no time for frivolous collection. The heat forces them to abandon the objective entirely.\n\nThe remaining swarm members beat their tattered wings and follow Apollyon's painful, hobbled retreat back toward the thick smoke pall from which they emerged. The French Engineers maintain their defensive fire until the last buzz fades into the distance, successfully defending the supply depot.\n\n**MISSION FAILED (2/10).** The overconfident, concentrated attack was perfectly countered by the Engineers' specialized anti-swarm technology, leading to massive casualties and a forced retreat.\n\n### In-Lore Mission Report: The Buzzing Harbingers\n\n**Mission Title:** Destruction of French Supply Depot\n**Character:** Pit Locust 'Apollyon' (Vanguard Swarm).\n**Date:** Unknown, Heavy Fog Conditions, 1561 A.D.\n**Location:** French Supply Depot, Western Front.\n**Primary Objective:** Destroy supplies and scatter formations.\n**Secondary Objective:** Neutralize Flamethrower defense.\n\n**Mission Summary:**\nPit Locust Apollyon elected to use a **Concentrated Dive** against the French anti-swarm defense. This was a catastrophic tactical error, as the French Engineers immediately and effectively deployed their three specialized **Flamethrowers**. The concentrated fire resulted in a **Critical Failure (Swarm Destruction)**, instantly destroying over half the attacking swarm and severely damaging Apollyon's wings. A **Desperate Retreat** was forced, resulting in the complete abandonment of the objective.\n\n**Hidden Dice Roll Log:**\n* Turn 2 (Anti-Swarm Defense): **Critical Failure (1/10)**\n\n**Outcome:** **Mission Failure (Tactical Defeat and Retreat)**. The swarm was repelled with heavy casualties.\n**Status:** **Swarm Decimated, Objective Undefended.** (Failure Count: 2/10)</s>"}
