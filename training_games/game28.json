{"text": "[SYSTEM: SCENARIO START: THE DIVINE ECHO - Faction: Gothic Cardinalate. Character: Observer Malachi. Objective: Breach the **Iron Sultanate** forward trench line and silence a heavy mortar crew that is pinning down the faithful. Setting: A cratered No-Man's Land, time is fluid due to the Oculus Helmet. END SCENARIO]\n\nNarrator:\n\nThe world is a cacophony of overlapping times. Through the crystal of your **Oculus Helmet**, you see the cratered mud of No-Man's Land as it was at Creation, as it is now, and as it will be in five seconds. The **Divine Echo** screams in your ears\u2014a billion prayers overlapping. Only the heavy cocktail of sedatives pumping through your veins keeps you anchored to the present.\n\nYou stand at the edge of the wire. Fifty meters ahead, an **Iron Sultanate** trench line bristles with rifles. A heavy mortar crew is loading a shell that\u2014in your vision\u2014has already landed and killed a squad of your brethren behind you. You grip your **trench polearm**.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Polearm Vault:** Sprint and use the polearm to vault the barbed wire and drop directly into the enemy trench, trusting the Eye of God to guide your evasion.\n2.  **Voice of Command:** Amplify your vox-emitters to project the Holy Word across the gap, attempting to command the mortar crew to \"CEASE\" from a distance.\n3.  **Wait for the Pattern:** Hold position for three seconds until the Sultanate heavy machine gun jams (as foreseen), then advance during the lull.\n\n[INST] 1 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 1**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Athletics/Foresight): 1d6. Result: 6 (Critical Success). Outcome: Perfect evasion; the Observer moves with supernatural fluidity.]\n\nYou trust the crystal. You sprint forward. To a mortal eye, it is suicide. To you, it is a choreographed dance. You see the Sultanate Janissary raise his rifle before his muscles even tense. You shift your torso three inches to the left. The bullet snaps through the space you just occupied.\n\nYou plant the base of your **trench polearm** into the mud and launch yourself into the air. You soar over the razor-wire, the battlefield rotating beneath you. As you descend, you see the future path of a bayonet thrust waiting for you below.\n\nYou land in the mud of the Sultanate trench with devastating force, your polearm sweeping out to decapitate the soldier whose attack you had already side-stepped before your boots touched the ground. You are inside the line. The mortar crew is ten meters to your right.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **The Voice:** Turn to the rushing Janissary reinforcements and utter the Holy Word \"KNEEL\" to compel them into submission.\n2.  **Drug Injection:** Your concentration is slipping due to the adrenaline; trigger a sedative injector to steady the Divine Echo before you fight.\n3.  **Polearm Sweep:** Spin the polearm in a wide arc to clear the narrow trench of the three soldiers blocking your path to the mortar.</s>\n\n[INST] 1 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 2**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Willpower/Command): 1d6. Result: 5 (Success). Outcome: The Command is effective; enemies are momentarily paralyzed by the Voice of God.]\n\nYou ignore the physical threat and focus your mind on the **Divine Echo**. It is deafening, a roar of history. You isolate a single syllable of the Creator's voice. The metal of your helmet vibrates, replicating the sound.\n\n**\"KNEEL.\"**\n\nThe sound is not heard with the ears, but felt in the soul. The three approaching **Iron Sultanate Janissaries** stumble. Their knees buckle against their will, their bodies betraying them to obey the command of the Almighty. They freeze, faces twisted in confusion and terror, their rifles pointed uselessly at the sky.\n\nThe mortar crew, however, is further away and shielded by the noise of their machine. They have loaded the shell. The future where your brethren die is becoming solid reality. The echo in your head is becoming screamingly loud; the effort of the Voice has strained your mental seal.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Inject Sedatives:** You must inject the chemical cocktail immediately to dampen the noise, or risk losing the Voice of God and your foresight.\n2.  **Charge Mortar:** Ignore the mental strain and the kneeling soldiers, rushing the mortar crew to kill them before they fire.\n3.  **Execute Janissaries:** Quickly dispatch the helpless soldiers while they are kneeling to ensure your rear is secure.</s>\n\n[INST] 2 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 3**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Mental Stability/Foresight): 1d6. Result: 2 (Failure/Mental Break). Outcome: The Observer ignores the necessary sedatives; the Divine Echo overwhelms the foresight.]\n\nYou choose to **Charge the Mortar**, prioritizing the mission over your own sanity. You sprint past the kneeling Janissaries.\n\nBut the cost is paid. Without the sedatives, the **Divine Echo** crescendos into a white-hot blinding noise. The separation between past, present, and future collapses. You see the mortar shell explode; you see the mortar crew being born; you see the iron ore of the cannon being mined.\n\nYour vision fractures. The \"minimum required movement\" needed to dodge becomes impossible to calculate because you see a thousand potential attacks simultaneously. A Janissary officer by the mortar draws a pistol. You try to dodge a bullet that hasn't been fired yet, stumbling into the path of the one that is.\n\nThe round strikes your shoulder, spinning you around. You drop to one knee, the world spinning in a kaleidoscope of time. The mortar crew pulls the firing lever.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Desperate Throw:** Hurl your trench polearm at the mortar shell as it exits the tube, hoping for a miraculous interception.\n2.  **Voice of Ruin:** Scream the Holy Word for \"UNMAKE\" at the mortar, pouring your very life force into a final command to shatter the machine.\n3.  **Chemical Overdose:** Slam every sedative injector you have at once, hoping to shock your brain back into the present moment for one final strike.</s>\n\n[INST] 2 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 4**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Sacrifice/Effectiveness): 1d6. Result: 6 (Critical Success/Fatal Cost). Outcome: The Mortar is destroyed, but the Observer's mind is burned out.]\n\nThere is no time for weapons. There is no time for drugs. You channel the entirety of the **Voice of God** coursing through your Oculus Helmet. You open your mouth and unleash a sound that no human throat should make.\n\n**\"BREAK.\"**\n\nThe resonance hits the **Iron Sultanate** mortar just as the shell leaves the tube. The metal of the cannon creates a sympathetic vibration so violent that the molecular bonds fail. The mortar shatters. The shell, caught in the vibration, detonates prematurely, not high in the air, but right there in the Sultanate trench.\n\nThe explosion vaporizes the crew and the officer. The trench collapses. The threat to the faithful is annihilated.\n\nBut the channel was too open. The Voice does not stop. It burns through your neural pathways. You collapse into the mud, the silence of the battlefield replaced by the eternal, roaring silence of a mind that has touched the infinite and shattered. You are alive, breathing, but **Observer Malachi** is gone, lost in the currents of time.\n\n[SYSTEM: NARRATIVE END]\n\n***\n\n## \u2705 In-Lore Mission Report: The Divine Echo\n\n### **Character & Faction:**\nObserver Malachi, Gothic Cardinalate.\n\n### **Objective:**\nSilence an Iron Sultanate heavy mortar position.\n\n### **Final Status:**\n**Mission Success (Objective Destroyed, Agent Incapacitated/MIA).**\n\n### **Summary of Action:**\nObserver Malachi utilized the **Trench Polearm** to successfully breach the enemy line, evading fire via the **Eye of God**.
