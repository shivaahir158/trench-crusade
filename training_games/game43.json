{"text": "[SYSTEM: SCENARIO START: **The Orichalcum Wall**\n\n**Character:** Mechanized Heavy Infantry Trooper **IGNIS** (Birth name: Klemens), assigned to a Close Quarters specialization suit. Trooper Ignis is nineteen, a veteran of six months, and has a newly-installed artificial arm purchased from the Sultanate's House of Wisdom, replacing the limb amputated to fit the suit's heavy shotgun mounting. His armor is the standard diesel-hydraulic model, weathered, bearing the name *IGNIS* in chipped Gothic script.\n\n**Setting:** A subterranean pumping station beneath the ruins of Old Antioch. This station is vital, feeding purified water to New Antioch's inner sector. Intelligence suggests a **Clockwork Heresy** cell—the enemy most obsessed with disrupting human machinery—is attempting to poison the intakes. The air is humid, smelling of stale water, diesel fumes, and the metallic tang of Heretic sabotage.\n\n**Initial Situation (Turn 1):** You are deep within the concrete tunnels, leading a fire-team of two un-armored Grenadiers. The tunnel ahead opens into the main pumping chamber, where the colossal filter-wheels spin. You hear the rhythmic, high-pitched *tapping* of metal on metal, a distinct sound of Heretic repair or modification. The Grenadiers, relying on you for protection, look nervous.\n\nEND SCENARIO] <s>\n\n##  Trench Crusade Adventure: The Orichalcum Wall\n\n**Narrator (Turn 1)**\nThe tapping grows louder, confirming the presence of the Clockwork Heresy in the main chamber. The concrete tunnel is narrow, forcing the two Grenadiers—Riker and the rookie, Vanya—to hug your orichalcum-steel flanks. Your heavy shotgun is loaded with dense, copper-jacketed slugs, ready for close-range lethality. The air pressure drops slightly as you near the main chamber, suggesting a breach has already occurred. You must act decisively before the Heretics contaminate the water supply.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action)**\nWhat is Trooper Ignis's next action?\n\n1.  **Breach and Overwhelm:** Kick down the rusted steel door to the chamber and immediately unleash the heavy shotgun into the darkness, using maximum shock and noise. (High risk, immediate engagement).\n2.  **Suppressing Fire:** Order the Grenadiers to saturate the doorway with fragmentation grenades before opening the door, trading explosives for suit integrity. (Moderate risk, safer entry).\n3.  **Silent Entry (Melee):** Attempt to manually unseal the door quietly and enter the chamber using the suit's crushing strength and your trench knife, relying on stealth. (High risk, avoids alarm).\n\n[INST] I choose option 3. Silent Entry, trench knife. [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Turn 2)**\nYou brace your immense armored shoulder against the rusted seal, the hydraulic pistons hissing quietly. Applying slow, steady pressure, the seal groans in protest. The rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of the Heretic's work is inches away. With a final, controlled burst of power, you shear the locking bar, allowing the door to swing inward on its hinges without a clang. You slip inside, grenade-wielding Grenadiers covering the threshold. The chamber is vast, lit by sickly green chem-lights. Three Heretics are working on the main intake valve—grotesque men whose flesh is crudely sewn onto rusting steam-pistons and who wield sparking tools. One of them, a smaller, quicker **Apostate Skitter-Servitor**, turns immediately, having sensed the air disturbance.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **Success (Stealth and Strength): 8/10** (The breach was successful and silent, granting surprise, but the closest enemy reacted quickly.)]]\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action)**\nThe Skitter-Servitor is raising a crude, piston-driven drill-arm toward the Grenadiers. The two Heretics near the valve are still focused on their sabotage, their backs to you.\n\n1.  **Eliminate the Threat:** Immediately shoot the Apostate Skitter-Servitor with the heavy shotgun to protect the Grenadiers and ensure silence. (Prioritize fire superiority).\n2.  **Target the Objective:** Ignore the immediate threat and charge the two Heretics near the valve, prioritizing the cessation of the sabotage. (High-speed objective denial).\n3.  **Command and Control:** Order Grenadier Riker to handle the Skitter-Servitor while you focus on placing a shaped charge on the intake valve, ready for detonation. (Split focus, rely on Grenadier support).\n\n[INST] I choose 2. Target the Objective. The water must be saved at all costs. Charge! [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Turn 3)**\n\"Hold the line!\" you grunt
