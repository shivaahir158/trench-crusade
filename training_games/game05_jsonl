Malgra used a **Vox-Alarm** for psychological warfare, successfully scattering the cultists and drawing in reinforcements. After repositioning to a defensible bunker and utilizing a **Quad-Barrel Heavy Stubber**, Malgra repelled and broke the cult's attack. The Inquisitor then pursued the scattered heretics, using the **Flamer** to ensure their complete, brutal annihilation. Finally, Malgra used the Flamer to **purify the mess hall**, destroying the ritual sites, the effigy, and all evidence of the cannibalistic rites. The cleansing fire compromised the seal on a hidden **metal access plate** beneath the main ritual fire pit. **Status:** Cult Purged. Garrison KIA/Eaten. Evidence of deeper corruption (hidden access plate) revealed.</s>"}
