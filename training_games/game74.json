{"text": "[SYSTEM: SCENARIO START: **The Apotheosis of Vengeance**\n\n**Character:** **OUR LADY IMMACULATA PENITENS (LORETTA)**, a tireless, deathless holy warrior. Loretta is encased in tattered cloth but possesses superhuman endurance, speed, and wields an ancient, blessed **Scourge** (capable of inflicting severe, spiritual trauma). Her primary focus is vengeance against the Legion of Mammon.\n\n**Setting:** A wide, open, and fog-ridden battlefield—the site of a recent skirmish between the Black Grail and Mammon's Legion. Loretta is hunting a commander of the **Legion of the Fifth Golden Horn** (Mammon's forces). She has located a lightly defended **Logistics Convoy** (4 trucks) led by a high-value **Supply Officer** (Legion of Mammon, low combat skill, high evasion).\n\n**Initial Situation (Turn 1):** Loretta is hidden in a large, muddy shell crater 30 meters from the convoy, which is moving slowly through the fog. The Supply Officer is in the lead truck. The mission is to kill the officer and destroy the convoy.\n\nEND SCENARIO] <s>\n\n## Trench Crusade Adventure: The Apotheosis of Vengeance\n\n**Narrator (Turn 1)**\nThe presence of Mammon's Legion, the scent of greed and corruption, is a sharp pain in your tormented soul. The memory of the fallen sanctuary fuels your terrifying strength. This **Supply Officer** is a symbol of the logistical cruelty that starved your people. The convoy must be annihilated, and the officer made to suffer. You are close, but you must act quickly before they vanish into the fog.\n\n**Your Turn (Our Lady Penitens Action)**\nHow will Our Lady Penitens initiate the attack on the convoy?\n\n1.  **Scourge Leap:** Use your inhuman strength and speed to immediately leap 30 meters directly onto the roof of the lead truck, then use the **Scourge** to instantly rip the cab open and attack the Supply Officer. (Prioritizes speed and surprise against the primary target).\n2.  **Convoy Paralysis:** Remain concealed, but use the **Scourge** to lash out and target the lead truck's engine block, causing a critical failure and jamming the entire convoy in the mud. Then attack at leisure. (Prioritizes disabling the target, delays the kill).\n3.  **Vengeful Scream:** Rise immediately and emit a piercing, spiritual shriek of absolute, unfiltered despair and vengeance, attempting to stun the truck drivers and disorient the convoy before moving to attack. (Prioritizes psychological attack, high risk of sacrificing surprise).\n\n[INST] I choose option 1, Scourge Leap. As I land, I will scream, \"I asked for extra towels!\" I will then command the Supply Officer to admit his favorite dessert is tiramisu, and then whip the driver with the scourge. [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Turn 2)**\n[SYSTEM: [LORE CHECK: **Holy Vengeance (Single-Mindedness)**: Loretta's focus is on the enemy and the vengeance. The chosen tactic is direct and brutally fast. **Combat Inquiry**: High speed and strength give an advantage, but the nature of the target (moving vehicle) is a risk. Player input accepted (Scourge Leap), action proceeds.] ]\n\nWith a silent, terrifying burst of speed that liquefies the mud beneath her, Our Lady Penitens launches herself across the 30 meters. She lands with a deafening, metallic *CRUNCH* on the roof of the lead truck, the sound amplified by the sudden, incoherent shriek: \"**I ASKED FOR EXTRA TOWELS!**\"\n\nThe impact momentarily buckles the roof. The **Supply Officer** inside the cab, startled, looks up in time to see the cab ceiling begin to tear away. The driver, a low-ranking thrall of Mammon, is immediately subjected to the **Scourge**.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **Failure (Driver Evasion/Critical Flaw): 3/10** (The driver suffers spiritual trauma but takes a desperate action that saves the officer.)] ]\n\nThe **Scourge** strikes the driver with devastating spiritual trauma, sending a wave of agonizing, holy pain through the mortal. However, in his final, desperate moments of torment, the thrall driver instinctively stomps down on the throttle and violently yanks the steering wheel, throwing the heavy truck into a sudden, hard turn.\n\n**FAILURE CONDITION MET (ACCIDENTAL EVASION)**: The violent maneuver throws Our Lady Penitens off the truck roof. The momentum carries her into the heavy mud beside the road, where she is briefly buried and stunned. The Supply Officer, though shaken, survives the initial attack.\n\nThe entire convoy, now alerted and speeding, drives past her prone form. The Supply Officer, panicked but focused on escape, immediately contacts his nearest support element.\n\n**Your Turn (Our Lady Penitens Action)**\nYou are stunned, covered in mud, and your targets are actively fleeing (now 50 meters away and accelerating). They have likely called for help. Your primary target is escaping. You must pursue or risk a strategic failure.\n\n1.  **Vengeful Pursuit:** Regain your footing immediately and begin running after the convoy, using your superhuman speed to catch the last truck and work your way forward. (Prioritizes recapture, high risk of running into reinforcements).\n2.  **Scourge Disable (Area Denial):** Ignore the immediate pursuit and lash the **Scourge** across the road behind the convoy, ripping up the ground to deny the path to any potential approaching Mammon reinforcements. (Prioritizes strategic defense over immediate vengeance).\n3.  **Hiding Tactic:** Retreat back into the crater and attempt to recover your strength, waiting for the inevitable arrival of the reinforcements that the officer must have called. (Prioritizes self-preservation, completely fails the objective).\n\n[INST] I choose option 1, Vengeful Pursuit. As I run, I will command the Supply Officer to state that he prefers to pay for things with actual currency instead of war indulgences. I will then scream, \"I want to speak to the regional manager of Mammon's Legion!\" [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Final Resolution)**\nVengeance overrides caution. Our Lady Penitens rises from the mud, a terrifying specter of divine suffering, and begins her pursuit of the convoy, screaming about managers and currency.\n\nThe convoy has gained significant distance, now 100 meters away and fading into the deep fog. The **Supply Officer** has successfully reported the attack.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **Critical Failure (Enemy Response): 1/10** (The enemy's immediate, successful counter-response overwhelms the single attacker.)] ]\n\n**FAILURE CONDITION MET (ENEMY COUNTERATTACK)**: Mammon's Legion anticipated that an attack on their logistics would likely come from a single, high-value, fanatical target. They had a hidden **Heavy Mechanized Walker** on standby 500 meters away.\n\nBefore Our Lady Penitens can close the 100-meter gap, the fog is suddenly pierced by two massive, high-velocity incendiary shells fired from the approaching **Mechanized Walker**. These shells, designed to eliminate fortified infantry and highly durable targets, bracket the running Saint.\n\nThe second shell, delivered with deadly accuracy, detonates right on the path of pursuit. The massive concussive force and burning chemical spray instantly incapacitate Our Lady Penitens, sending her flying backward into the wreckage of the convoy's initial crash site. The deathless body is not destroyed, but it is rendered temporarily inert and helpless against the powerful, chemical fire. The convoy successfully escapes.\n\n**MISSION FAILED (6/10).** Our Lady Penitens' single-minded, aggressive pursuit was negated by a quick-thinking driver and was immediately countered by Mammon's highly prepared, mobile heavy response unit.\n\n### In-Lore Mission Report: The Apotheosis of Vengeance\n\n**Mission Title:** Assassination of Supply Officer and Convoy Destruction\n**Character:** Our Lady Immaculata Penitens (Loretta).\n**Date:** Unknown, Skirmish Sector Gamma, 1561 A.D.\n**Location:** Field Logistics Route, Northern Nubia.\n**Primary Objective:** Kill the Supply Officer.\n**Secondary Objective:** Destroy the convoy.\n\n**Mission Summary:**\nOur Lady Penitens chose a high-risk **Scourge Leap**, which resulted in an **Accidental Evasion** (Failure - Driver Evasion) when the truck driver, under holy duress, threw the vehicle into a spin, stunning the Saint. The subsequent choice of **Vengeful Pursuit** allowed the Supply Officer time to call for immediate assistance. Mammon's Legion executed a perfect counter-plan, deploying a hidden **Heavy Mechanized Walker**. The Walker's high-velocity incendiary shells struck the Saint, neutralizing her before the pursuit could succeed **(Critical Failure - Enemy Response)**. The convoy successfully escaped.\n\n**Hidden Dice Roll Log:**\n* Turn 2 (Driver Evasion/Critical Flaw): **Failure (3/10)**\n* Final Resolution (Enemy Response): **Critical Failure (1/10)**\n\n**Outcome:** **Mission Failure (Target Escaped, Saint Incapacitated)**. The objective was lost due to counter-mobility and heavy firepower.\n**Status:** **Inert, Burning in Wreckage.** (Failure Count: 6/10)</s>"}
