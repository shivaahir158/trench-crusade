Armed with **Incendiary Cannons**.\n**Mission:** Destroy the Heretic transport blimp, **The Gilded Coffin**, before it reaches enemy territory.\n**Setting:** High altitude, heavy cloud cover over the North Sea.\n**Initial Situation (Turn 1):** The massive, armored blimp is ahead. The psychic atmosphere of despair is already overwhelming the cockpit's spiritual defenses, triggering deep-seated combat fatigue and doubt in Ludvig.\n\nEND SCENARIO] <s>\n\n## Trench Crusade Adventure: The Gilded Coffin\n\n**Narrator (Turn 1)**\nThe temperature drops sharply, even within your pressurized cockpit. **The Gilded Coffin** is an obscene spectacle, a fortress of despair floating above the waves. The psychic pressure is immense; it feels like the collective sorrow of a thousand souls crashing against your mind, amplifying every memory of loss and failure. You know the blimp is carrying captives—they will be taken to the Court, tortured, and potentially corrupted into Warlocks. You must destroy the blimp to free them from that fate, but the moral weight of killing the captives yourself is crushing your will.\n\n**Your Turn (Air Knight Action)**\nHow will Ludvig Svensson overcome the psychological and moral pressure to complete his grim mission?\n\n1.  **Direct Incendiary Attack (Rapid Engagement):** Dive immediately and fire the **Incendiary Cannons** in a full, sustained burst, prioritizing maximum damage and rapid destruction before the psychic defenses overwhelm the pilot. (Prioritizes mission objective, high risk of missing due to mental tremor).\n2.  **Evasive Maneuvers (Psychic Evasion):** Break off the attack and fly a wide, serpentine course, attempting to use the cloud cover and speed to temporarily escape the blimp's psychic range and clear your head before attempting a second pass. (Prioritizes pilot stability, high risk of losing the slow-moving target in the clouds/fog).\n3.  **Spiritual Counter-Chant:** Temporarily disengage the auto-pilot and recite a powerful anti-despair litany into the comms system, pushing back against the psychic assault while holding a steady course. (Prioritizes spiritual defense, high risk of losing control of the fighter).\n\n[INST] I choose option 2, Evasive Maneuvers (Psychic Evasion). I will whisper, \"Not today, not like this,\" and internally blame the Kalmar Union Quartermaster for issuing cheap spiritual shielding. [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Turn 2)**\n[SYSTEM: [LORE CHECK: **Air Knight Combat Fatigue**: Elite pilots are often fragile under extreme, constant pressure. **Tactical Inquiry**: The blimp is slow but the cloud cover is dense. Player input accepted (Evasive Maneuvers), action proceeds.] ]\n\nLudvig pulls the stick hard and sends the Sky-Fighter into a tight, evasive spiral. He uses the dense, cold cloud bank to try and shield his mind from the crushing psychic presence. He gains distance, but the moment he relaxes his focus, the deep-seated exhaustion and moral conflict return with crushing force. The sight of the massive, slow target—and the knowledge of the human cargo—has broken his fighting spirit.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **Critical Failure (Moral Collapse): 1/10** (The pilot loses the will to fight and sacrifices the mission.)] ]\n\n**FAILURE CONDITION MET (PSYCHOLOGICAL BREAKDOWN)**: Ludvig Svensson, confronted by the moral horror of killing his own people to prevent their corruption, and overwhelmed by the sheer psychic weight of their suffering, can no longer commit to the strike. His hands tremble, his vision blurs with unshed tears, and he is unable to steady the fighter for the second attack. He chooses the path of denial over duty.\n\n**Your Turn (Air Knight Action)**\nYou have successfully evaded the immediate psychic assault, but the blimp is still visible, moving steadily toward Heretic territory. You know that if you don't strike now, the captives are doomed to a worse fate, but you cannot bring yourself to fire. You have one final chance to choose a course of action before the blimp passes beyond the point of no return.\n\n1.  **Forced Disengagement:** Radio command to report a *technical failure* and request immediate return, knowing you are lying but preserving your sanity and your life. (Prioritizes self-preservation, total mission failure).\n2.  **Warning Pass:** Make a low, fast pass over **The Gilded Coffin**, firing a single, non-lethal warning burst with the **Incendiary Cannons** to signal the captives that rescue is impossible, then return home. (Prioritizes moral signaling, ensures the blimp escapes).\n3.  **Bailout and Suicide Sabotage:** Activate the self-destruct mechanism on the Sky-Fighter, eject immediately, and guide the self-destructing fighter into the blimp, sacrificing yourself to complete the mission. (Prioritizes objective, certain death/sacrifice).\n\n[INST] I choose option 1, Forced Disengagement. I will radio, \"Structural failure in the starboard wing,\" and internally resolve to drink heavily once he lands. [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Final Resolution)**\nAir Knight Ludvig Svensson sacrifices his honor for his sanity. He reports a false catastrophic failure and turns the fighter back toward Kalmar Union territory.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **Failure (Mission Abandonment): 3/10** (The pilot successfully retreats, but the high-value target is lost.)] ]\n\n**MISSION FAILED (17/10).** **The Gilded Coffin** proceeds unmolested into enemy territory. The high-value captives are delivered to the Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent, where they will be subjected to unspeakable horrors and converted into **Goetic Warlocks**. Ludvig Svensson returns alive, his fighter intact, but his reputation is tarnished by suspicion, and his spirit is permanently broken by the moral weight of his choice. He failed to pull the trigger when duty demanded it.\n\n### In-Lore Mission Report: The Gilded Coffin\n\n**Mission Title:** Intercept and Destroy High-Value Captive Transport\n**Character:** Air Knight 'Ludvig Svensson'.\n**Date:** Unknown, North Sea Airspace.\n**Location:** High Altitude Interception Zone.\n**Primary Objective:** Destroy The Gilded Coffin.\n\n**Mission Summary:**\nLudvig chose the evasive route, leading to a **Critical Failure (Psychological Breakdown)**, where the immense psychic pressure and the moral horror of killing the captives paralyzed his ability to execute the mission.
