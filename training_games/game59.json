{"text": "[SYSTEM: SCENARIO START: **The Echo of Greed**\n\n**Character:** **TRENCH GHOST ZACHARY**, an ordinary fallen Heretic soldier, now a silent shade bound to the Earth. He is filled with cold misery and an envy for the living. He is armed with a rusted **Bolt Action Rifle** and wears a torn **Gas Mask**. His primary ability is his inherent **Bottomless Hatred and Envy** (passive aura against the living).\n\n**Setting:** A ruined, half-collapsed church in the middle of No Man's Land. The Ghosts have established a hidden hoard of looted treasures here, driven by the compulsion of former greed.\n\n**Initial Situation (Turn 1):** Ghost Zachary is standing guard over the hidden hoard, a pile of ducats, watches, and silverware in the church's old crypt. A glimmer catches his eye: a small, preserved **leather-bound diary** lying near the hoard, not part of it. The diary has a familiar, faded **family crest** on its cover—a crest Zachary faintly recalls from his mortal life. His fellow guard, another **Trench Ghost**, lurches silently in the corner, focused on polishing a stolen bayonet.\n\nEND SCENARIO] <s>\n\n## Trench Crusade Adventure: The Echo of Greed\n\n**Narrator (Turn 1)**\nThe crypt is cold, silent, and permeated with the thick, dust-like sentience of the trapped dead. Your existence is a miserable cycle of compulsion and cold decay. The hoard means nothing, yet you feel compelled to protect it. The diary, however, radiates a faint, unsettling echo of warmth—the warmth of a living memory, a thing you despise but desperately crave. It is a relic of your mortal life before the Great War claimed you.\n\n**Your Turn (Trench Ghost Action)**\nHow will Ghost Zachary address the diary, this spark of unwanted humanity?\n\n1.  **Consume the Relic:** Immediately use your cold, hateful touch to rip the diary to shreds, exorcising the memory and eliminating the distraction. (Prioritizes denial of memory, high emotional damage).\n2.  **Attempt to Read:** Lurch toward the diary and attempt to flip through the pages, trying to connect the fading memory of the family crest to your current, miserable existence. (Prioritizes confrontation of memory, high risk of despair).\n3.  **Loot Addition:** With the compulsion of greed, shove the diary onto the hoard pile and resume your guard duty, denying its sentimental value but submitting to the compulsion to hoard. (Prioritizes compulsion over memory, maintains the status quo).\n\n[INST] I choose option 2, Attempt to Read. As I read, I will try to remember what my favorite ice cream flavor was and if my mortal self ever successfully learned to tap dance. I will also try to trade the diary to the other Trench Ghost for the stolen bayonet, using a hand signal that means, \"Shiny murder stick for sad words.\" [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Turn 2)**\n[SYSTEM: [LORE CHECK: **Trading/Tap Dancing (Compulsion/Memory)**: The Ghost's actions are driven by a meaningless compulsion for *looting* and *drills*, not complex bartering or recreational memory. The desire for the familiar bayonet, however, is a reasonable extension of the compulsion to equip. Player input accepted (Attempt to Read/Memory Focus), narrative elements integrated into the Ghost's confused state.] ]\n\nThe cold hand of Ghost Zachary reaches out and grasps the diary. The leather is surprisingly soft and warm in your grip, a shocking sensation after endless years of cold misery. As you flip open the cover, the script inside is a jumble of faded names and mundane accounts of a life you dimly recall—a mortgage, a child's birthday, a recurring dental appointment.\n\nYou attempt to search the barren tracts of your mind for the flavor of a sweet, frozen treat or the rhythm of a forgotten dance. The effort is pointless. There is only a crushing emptiness where memory should be, replaced by the relentless, cold envy for the living who still hold such trivial records.\n\nYou look at the other Trench Ghost, whose gaze is fixed with obsessive greed on his shiny bayonet. You raise the diary and attempt a complicated hand signal—**Shiny murder stick for sad words**—an inscrutable gesture of trade.\n\nThe other Ghost stares back for a moment, then shakes his head with a slow, grinding rasp. He repeats a simple, rhythmic hand signal that is universally understood among your kind: **No trade. Drill.** He is compelled to practice, not barter. The diary is yours, and the memory, however painful, lingers.\n\n**Your Turn (Trench Ghost Action)**\nThe memory is too strong, the pain too immediate. The diary's contents—this small, preserved piece of human life—fill you with agonizing hatred. You are still holding the diary and the painful connection to the living world.\n\n1.  **Obsessive Guard:** Immediately shove the diary into your tunic and resume your patrol of the crypt, trying to use the repetition of duty to extinguish the nascent spark of despair. (Prioritizes compulsion and denial).\n2.  **Psychic Broadcast (Wail):** Give in to the bottomless hatred and emit a full, terrible spectral wail, aiming to broadcast your despair and hatred into the living world outside the crypt, regardless of the noise. (Prioritizes emotional release, high-risk detection).\n3.  **Offer of Envy (Ritual):** Attempt to scratch open the pages of the diary with your rusted bayonet and ritually smear the resulting pulp onto your own ruined face, hoping to symbolically consume the life recorded within and ease your envy. (Prioritizes dark ritual, highest confrontation with the relic).\n\n[INST] I choose option 3, Offer of Envy (Ritual). As I smear the pages on my face, I will try to whisper a poem about the tragedy of having an oddly-shaped foot. I will then command the other Trench Ghost to stop polishing the bayonet and instead start a ghostly military drill where he has to pretend to be a very, very small duck. [/INST] <s>\n\n**Narrator (Final Resolution)**\n[SYSTEM: [LORE CHECK: **Whispering/Commands (Silence/Compulsion)**: Trench Ghosts are mostly silent save for their spectral wails and are driven by the compulsion of drills, which are usually organized and military. Player input accepted (Ritual), chaotic elements overridden by the core lore of silence and grim purpose.] ]\n\nThe whisper of a poem is impossible; your throat only manages a dry, clicking sound like stones grinding together. However, the raw compulsion to act is overwhelming.\n\nDriven by an agonizing, blinding envy for the simple life the diary represents, you produce your own rusted bayonet and begin the gruesome ritual.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **Critical Success (Ritual of Envy): 10/10** (The extreme, symbolic act allows the Ghost to briefly \"feel\" something, successfully overwhelming the immediate despair.)] ]\n\nThe sensation is not warmth, but a searing *cold*. For a brief, terrifying moment, you *feel* the essence of life—the pain, the joy, the ambition—all the things forever denied to you. This terrible, freezing contact floods your undead consciousness with a renewed, bottomless surge of hatred and envy toward the living. The raw emotional outpouring temporarily overloads the immediate memory, allowing the cold compulsion of the Trench Ghost to reassert itself.\n\nThe other Trench Ghost, oblivious to your inner torment, finally complies with the unspoken, non-duck-related military ritual. He lurches from the corner and begins a series of slow, rhythmic, pointless maneuvers with his bayonet, the clicking of his dry, dead joints echoing the empty motions of war.\n\nGhost Zachary returns to his post. The human memory is temporarily banished, replaced by the comforting, miserable emptiness of un-life and the cold, eternal rage that sustains the Trench Ghost. The hoard is safe, and the long, pointless vigil continues.\n\n### In-Lore Mission Report: The Echo of Greed\n\n**Mission Title:** Internal Vigil (Crypt Hoard Security)\n**Character:** Trench Ghost Zachary, Bound Shade of No Man's Land.\n**Date:** Unknown.\n**Location:** Ruined Church Crypt.\n**Primary Objective:** Secure the looted hoard (Compulsion fulfillment).\n**Secondary Objective:** Suppress the memory of the living world.\n\n**Mission Summary:**\nGhost Zachary encountered a preserved diary from his mortal life, triggering a moment of painful, existential despair and envy toward the living. After a failed attempt to trade the relic, Zachary succumbed to his hatred, performing a ritualized act of **Envy Consumption**. By destroying and smearing the diary's pages onto his face, he momentarily overloaded his dead consciousness with the essence of life, which paradoxically resulted in a powerful resurgence of his core **Bottomless Hatred and Envy**. This emotional surge successfully suppressed the immediate despair, allowing the Ghost to return to the empty compulsion of his guard duty.\n\n**Hidden Dice Roll Log:**\n* Turn 2 (Symbolic Trade): **Failure (No trade)**\n* Final Resolution (Ritual of Envy): **Critical Success (10/10)**\n\n**Outcome:** **Critical Victory (Memory Suppressed)**. The Ghost successfully used hatred to overcome a lapse into humanity.\n**Status:** **Vigil Resumed, Despair Maintained**.</s>"}
