"text": "<s>\n[INST]\n**Narrator (AI):** A new wave of Black Guard troops—grim, determined shock infantry—emerges from the shattered western archway, forming a shield wall 75 meters away. They are supported by a Black Guard Commissar, easily identified by his tall, crimson-plumed helm. Brother Lucian reports: *\"They've got a heavy flamer team on the left flank, Captain! We need to suppress that fire or Silas will burn!\"*\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n* **Open Fire:** Unleash the Twin-Link Heavy Machine Gun Lance on the advancing shield wall, focusing fire on the Commissar.\n* **Charge Melee:** Power-walk forward and prepare to engage the closest infantry with the Vibro-Axe, forcing them to break formation.\n* **Focus Flamer Team:** Direct Lucian to use the lance to specifically suppress the flamer team, sacrificing damage on the main body.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nOpen Fire on the shield wall, but have Lucian target the flamer guys with a quick burst! Also, tell Silas to get behind me.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** Excellent tactical response, Captain. You prioritize the main threat but ensure your flank is covered.\n\nYou roar your orders over the vox: *\"Silas, behind the leg actuator! Lucian, two-second burst on the left flank, then return to the main body!\"*\n\nYou brace *The Pillar of Life* and unleash the **Twin-Link Heavy Machine Gun Lance**. The sustained roar is deafening, and tracer fire rips into the Black Guard shield wall. Meanwhile, Brother Lucian expertly snaps off a rapid burst at the flamer team.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Lance Suppression Check):** Rolled 33. **Result:** Success. The flamer team is pinned and temporarily suppressed.]]\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Main Body Damage Check):** Rolled 71. **Result:** Failure. Heavy armor deflects most damage, but the Commissar is shaken.]]\n\nYour sustained fire shatters the cohesion of the shield wall, sending men scattering, but the Black Guard's heavy carapace armor holds up. Only three infantrymen are killed, but the Commissar drops to one knee, momentarily stunned. The flamer team is pinned down in the wreckage, but still operational.\n\nHowever, the sustained twin-link fire has pushed your heat levels to the red line. *HEAT WARNING 85%... COOLING FAILURE IMMINENT.*\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n* **Melee Assault:** Initiate a full-power charge with the Vibro-Axe to capitalize on the broken formation and deal with the Commissar directly.\n* **Switch Weapons:** Cease fire on the lance and hold position, allowing your suit to vent heat while waiting for the next attack.\n* **Unleash the Saint:** Perform the **Iron Rites of Theron**, invoking the Saint of Gears for immediate mechanical cooling and power boost.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI don't have time to wait for the suit to cool down, and I definitely don't want to get stuck in melee if I overheat. Let's try the Iron Rites and see if we can get a cool-down miracle. The Heretics taught us the risk is the reward. **Unleash the Saint**.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** The logic of mechanical faith guides your hand. You ignore the protests of your inner pilot and begin the grating, rhythmic invocation of the forbidden rites over the vox-caster.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Divine Intervention/Heat Check):** Rolled 96. **Result:** Catastrophic Failure. Chaotic Manifestation and Mechanical Collapse.]]\n\nThe power drain of the forbidden prayer, combined with the extreme heat, results in a catastrophic feedback loop. The suit doesn't cool; it *spikes* in temperature. The air around the *Pillar of Life* shimmers with heat, then ozone. Instead of sandalwood, the scent of hot, burnt insulation fills the cockpit.\n\nThe suit's internal systems lock up. The **Vibro-Axe** goes inert. The machine gun lance is fused to its mount. *HEAT CRITICAL 100%... ENGINE SHUTDOWN.* Your Maximilian armor is a 10-foot tall metal statue, perfectly **immobile** and rapidly radiating heat.\n\nThe Black Guard Commissar, seeing your total paralysis, stands up, draws his ceremonial power sword, and bellows a counter-charge order. The remaining infantry and the flamer team surge forward, sensing the kill.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n* **Eject Now:** Initiate the emergency ejection sequence immediately, abandoning the million-kilo suit and fighting on foot with the Men-At-Arms.\n* **Rally the Brethren:** Ignore the Commissar and scream at Lucian and Silas to focus fire on the **Flamer Team**, which is the greatest threat to your immobilized position.\n* **Smash the Glass:** Use the emergency cockpit breaching tool to manually smash the viewport, venting heat and offering a desperate, close-range firing solution with your personal pistol.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI am Captain Elias, I will not abandon The Pillar of Life! Silas and Lucian are protected by the bulk of the suit. I will **Rally the Brethren** and then **Smash the Glass** and take a shot at that Commissar.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** A true Knight endures. You order your Men-At-Arms: *\"Focus fire on the burning menace! Protect this machine! For the Banner!\"* Brother Silas and Brother Lucian—terrified but loyal—pivot, laying down rifle fire at the advancing flamer team.\n\nThen, you act: you grab the emergency breaching tool—a ceremonial adamantium hammer—and smash the thick, insulated viewport glass. The glass fractures violently, venting scalding hot air and a gout of smoke. You raise your personal sidearm, a heavy plasma pistol, and aim at the advancing Commissar.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Personal Weapon Shot vs. Commissar):** Rolled 14. **Result:** Critical Success. Headshot.]]\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Men-At-Arms Suppression Check):** Rolled 55. **Result:** Marginal Success. Flamer team halted.]]\n\nThe plasma pistol blast is true. The Commissar's crimson-plumed helm vaporizes in a flash of white-hot plasma, and the officer drops instantly. The Black Guard formation immediately falters, their will broken by the loss of their leader. Meanwhile, your Men-At-Arms successfully force the flamer team to take cover.\n\nYou have won a precious few seconds, but the suit remains a dead hunk of metal, and the flamer team is still alive. You hear the deep, chilling chanting of the Black Guard reserves approaching the western archway.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n* **Full Retreat:** Order the Men-At-Arms to pull you out of the trench, dragging the entire immobilized suit back to friendly lines.\n* **Pray Again:** With the Commissar dead, attempt the **Iron Rites** one more time, hoping the success will negate the corruption.\n* **Use the Flamer:** Order Lucian and Silas to secure the abandoned flamer team's weapon and use it against the newly arriving reserves.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI need the suit to function, I'll Pray Again. What's the worst that can happen? The suit is already dead and I am exposed. The Lord protects the faithful, even the reckless ones. Pray Again!\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** The desperation of the faithful knows no limit. With the Commissar's death acting as a successful offering, you once again try the forbidden invocation. You clutch your consecrated dog tags and speak the rites into the breach in your viewport.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Divine Intervention/Redemption Check):** Rolled 9. **Result:** Critical Success (Chaotic Redemption). Intervention Tainted.]]\n\nInstead of the Saint, a shadow falls over you. The air becomes impossibly cold. The metal of *The Pillar of Life* begins to weep a thick, dark oil.\n\nSuddenly, the suit reactivates. Not cooled, but *frozen*. The thick oil becomes a protective sheet of black ice, sealing the viewport breach. The **Twin-Link Lance** rips itself free from its jammed mount with a shriek of tearing metal, now floating unnaturally beside your chassis. The **Vibro-Axe** begins to pulse with cold, dark energy.\n\nA voice—not the Saint's whisper, but a heavy, echoing baritone—booms in your mind: *\"The WILL is FREE. The POWER is GRANTED. NOW, KILL.\"*\n\nYou are no longer overheating. You are a cold, implacable, machine-ghost of vengeance. The Black Guard reserves, arriving at the archway, see the frozen, oil-weeping Knight and freeze in terror.\n\n**Final Outcome:** The line holds, the objective is secured, and the suit is fully operational. But the Knight's connection to the Saint has been replaced by something far darker and more powerful: the **Void Engine of the Unbreakable Will**.\n\n---\n\n## 📜 In-Lore Mission Report: The Clockwork Cathedral Defense\n\n### **Agent:** Brother-Captain Elias, Knight of the Argent Banner (*The Pillar of Life*).\n### **Target Objective:** Defend the catacombs entrance and repel the Black Guard counter-attack.\n### **Operation Code:** 'Frozen Angel'\n### **Status:** **SUCCESS (VOID-INFUSED / EXISTENCE COMPROMISED)**\n\n**Summary:** Captain Elias led a successful defense, neutralizing the Black Guard Commissar and preventing the enemy from reaching the Sarcophagus of the Unbreakable Will. The mission was nearly lost due to a catastrophic engine failure induced by the unauthorized use of the Iron Rites.\n\n**Divine/Heretical Intervention:** The second, successful invocation resulted not in the grace of the Butchered Saint, but the manifestation of a **Void Engine-aligned Entity**. The entity *corrected* the suit's failure by replacing its heat-dependent function with a cold, oil-based system, simultaneously granting autonomous power to its weaponry. The Knight is now operating outside known technical and theological parameters.\n\n**Cost to Faith:** The Sarcophagus is safe, but *The Pillar of Life* is now a vessel for a powerful, non-Cardinalate entity. Agent Elias’s mental state is stable, but he now exhibits extreme, unnerving calm and zero body heat. His armor weeps black oil instead of steam. **Recommendation:** Do not attempt extraction. The asset is too volatile and powerful. The Knight and his two loyal Men-At-Arms are to be reassigned indefinitely to the most critical, lost cause front lines. He is designated a **Warden of the Void Gate**, and the fate of his soul is irrelevant next to his combat potential.\n\n***\n\n"
