Archbishop Volkov's final words echo in your mind: *\"Failure, Sister Agata, is a betrayal of the Lord and the millions who died for His grace.\"*\n\nYou stand at the edge of the forward trench, 'The Anvil.' Below you is \"The Grinder,\" a corpse-choked ditch running straight into enemy lines, bathed in the sickly green light of sporadic flares. You hear a metallic clanking sound echoing from The Grinder—definitely Sultanate Mechanists, moving fast.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Descend Immediately:** Scramble down the sheer wall into The Grinder, hoping to reach the reliquary before the Mechanists.\n2. **Scout First:** Move along the edge of The Anvil trench to a better vantage point, risking valuable time for information.\n3. **Pledge a Vow:** Take a moment to invoke the Butchered Saint for divine aid, preparing for a confrontation.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\n1\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** Without hesitation, you drop your gear and slide down the mud and refuse of the trench wall. You hit the bottom of 'The Grinder' with a splash, the ground beneath your feet squelching with mud, water, and something far softer. The air here is cold and heavy.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Speed/Agility Check):** Rolled 12. **Result:** Critical Success.]\n\nYou move with the unnatural swiftness of the faithful, your boots barely making a sound. You round a corner and see it: a pair of Iron Sultanate Mechanists—their four-armed bodies encased in oily, brass-plated armor—are already inspecting a small, ornate silver box resting atop a pile of spent shell casings. It is the reliquary.\n\nYou are 10 meters away. Their back is to you. They have not yet seen you.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Fire the Redemption:** Draw your auto-pistol and open fire on the nearest Mechanist, prioritizing swift elimination.\n2. **Charge with the Chain-Scourge:** Shout a battle-cry and close the distance, relying on the blessed scourges to bypass their armor.\n3. **Heck, I'll go for the big one first!**\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\n3\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** A surge of righteous fury courses through you. You ignore the smaller, more immediate threat and focus on the larger, more heavily-armored Mechanist, likely the Engineer in charge. You draw your 'Redemption' auto-pistol and unleash a burst of consecrated high-velocity rounds.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Attack Check vs. Heavy Armor):** Rolled 88. **Result:** Marginal Failure. The heavy, four-plated armor deflects the brunt of the attack.]\n\nThe rounds strike the Engineer's massive chassis with a screech of tearing metal, but fail to penetrate vital systems. Instead, they merely spark against the brass plating. The Mechanist bellows a guttural cry of surprise and pain, spinning around to face you. The second, smaller Mechanist drops the reliquary, its four metallic hands raising a complicated-looking welding tool that is now spitting a stream of white-hot plasma.\n\nYou are caught in the open, your weapon already blazing, and you have failed to secure a quick kill.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Take Cover and Reload:** Dive behind a stack of rusted oil drums and attempt to reload your pistol, sacrificing an attack to break line-of-sight.\n2. **Engage with the Chain-Scourge:** Drop the empty auto-pistol and charge, attempting to wrap the chain-scourge around the Engineer's exposed neck-joint.\n3. **Throw a Consecrated Grenade:** Toss a 'Penitent' pattern fragmentation grenade toward the two Mechanists.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nThrow a Consecrated Grenade\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** You know a protracted gunfight against armored Mechanists in a confined space is suicide. You quickly shift your weight, pull the pin on a **'Penitent' fragmentation grenade**—blessed by the High Cardinal himself—and hurl it toward the pair of Sultanate scavengers.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Explosive Scatter Check):** Rolled 31. **Result:** Success.]\n\nThe grenade bounces off the chest plate of the smaller Mechanist with a dull *clank* and detonates with a deafening roar. Shrapnel laced with blessed silver tears through the air. The explosion is blinding. The Engineer, already damaged, is thrown against the trench wall, a torrent of hydraulic fluid spraying from his chest casing. The smaller Mechanist, caught at ground zero, is instantly reduced to a heap of smoking, shredded brass and meat. The *plasma cutter* it held spins away, burying itself into the mud.\n\nThe Engineer is alive but clearly disabled, twitching violently. The reliquary, thankfully, remains intact on the ground beside the wreckage.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Finish the Engineer and Retrieve:** Execute the disabled Engineer with your chain-scourge and grab the reliquary.\n2. **Focus Solely on the Reliquary:** Ignore the Engineer and prioritize securing the relic immediately, as reinforcements might be incoming.\n3. **Pledge Another Vow:** Spend a turn praying over the disabled Engineer, hoping to offer a final chance for divine intervention/pity.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\n2\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** The mission objective supersedes the joy of the kill. You sprint past the writhing Engineer—its metallic limbs flailing uselessly—and scoop up the ornate, silver Reliquary of the Saint of Gears. It is cold to the touch, and you can sense the faint, rhythmic *thrumming* of the preserved, desiccated heart within.\n\nAs you turn to retreat, the disabled Engineer lets out a piercing, high-frequency screech, likely a distress signal to the *Void Engines*.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Reinforcement Alert Check):** Rolled 94. **Result:** Catastrophic Failure. The distress signal was successful and amplified.]\n\nYou hear a heavy, synchronized metallic *thudding* approaching fast from the south end of The Grinder—more than just two Mechanists. You must escape immediately, but your route back up 'The Anvil' wall is too slow.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Flee North:** Run further into the Iron Sultanate's side of The Grinder, hoping to find a hidden drain or tunnel network to escape the trench line.\n2. **Pray to the Saint:** Clutch the reliquary and begin the 'Prayer of the Final Hour,' hoping the relic itself attracts the Butchered Saint's intercession.\n3. **Use the Plasma Cutter:** Grab the smaller Mechanist's abandoned plasma cutter and attempt to slice a quick escape hole through the trench wall.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\nI don't have time for prayers! I'm going to grab that cutter and melt my way out. 3!\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** Practicality wins out over piety. You grab the salvaged plasma cutter—still hot and spitting residual energy—and heave its bulk toward the nearest section of rusted iron sheeting reinforced with concrete. You activate the weapon, and the air immediately fills with the ear-splitting hiss of superheated gas eating through metal.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Technical/Salvage Check):** Rolled 5. **Result:** Critical Success. The weapon operates perfectly, albeit too powerfully.]\n\nThe plasma cutter functions flawlessly, tearing a jagged, man-sized hole through the reinforced wall in seconds. However, the uncontrolled heat and concussive sound attract immediate attention. As you clamber through the smoking aperture, you see three hulking Mechanist Enforcers rounding the bend, their optical sensors focusing on your position.\n\nYou emerge from the trench into a dense field of razor wire and static artillery shells, far behind friendly lines, but exposed. The thudding of enemy feet is right behind you.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):**\n1. **Attempt to cross the Wire:** Immediately sprint through the razor wire field and attempt to reach the relative safety of the shattered woods beyond.\n2. **Lay a Trap:** Drop the plasma cutter and prime your remaining grenade, waiting just inside the hole to ambush the first pursuing Mechanist.\n3. **Invoke the Machine God's Name:** Shout a phrase of blasphemous Iron Sultanate dogma to confuse or momentarily stall the Enforcers.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\n1\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** There is no time for subtlety or counter-attack. You tuck the Reliquary of the Saint of Gears into your habit and launch yourself into the treacherous, head-high **razor wire field**. You move with a desperate urgency, focused only on the woods, the metal barbs tearing at your flesh and habit.\n\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: **1d100 (Agility/Endurance Check):** Rolled 98. **Result:** Catastrophic Failure. Injury sustained.]\n\nYour foot catches on a coil of barbed wire hidden beneath the mud. You crash face-first into the ground, the delicate wire slicing deep into your leg and arms. The pain is blinding, and the shock forces the breath from your lungs.\n\nThe three Mechanist Enforcers emerge from the hole in the trench wall, their weapon arrays powering up. Their low, synthesized voices drone in unison: *\"Interloper. Relic secured. Execution Protocol initiated.\"*\n\nA brilliant, burning light fills the trench. A silent presence descends. The air fills with the scent of sandalwood and flakes of gold leaf.\n\nBefore the Enforcers can fire, the ground around them liquefies into a sickening, green-tinged ichor. Their heavy feet sink instantly, trapping them. Then, the Mechanists’ armor plates begin to bubble, melt, and peel away in agonising sheets of scalding metal. The Enforcers collapse with high-pitched, dying electronic screams.\n\nStanding atop the razor wire, seemingly untouched, is a slender figure clothed in tattered, lace-adorned vestments and an exquisite silver death mask. The **Butchered Saint** has arrived. She looks down at you, her mask expressionless.\n\n**Your Turn (Player Action):\n(Final Turn - Outcome Decisive)**\n1. **Accept Aid:** Humbly reach out and grasp the Saint's hand, allowing her to pull you from the wire.\n2. **Demand Justice:** Point at the fleeing Mechanists (you see another small group retreating in the distance) and demand the Saint pursue them.\n3. **Attempt to Convert:** Try to speak, reciting the Litany of the Martyr's Grace to the Saint.\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n[INST]\n1\n[/INST]\n</s>\n<s>\n**Narrator (AI):** You ignore the pain, the horror, and the theological implication of the vision, and simply focus on survival. You reach your bloodied hand toward the figure of the Butchered Saint.\n\nShe extends a slender, white-gloved hand toward you. The touch is cold, yet simultaneously searing with divine power. As her fingers close around your wrist, the deep, agonizing cuts inflicted by the razor wire instantly seal and scab over. She lifts you effortlessly, placing you gently on the firm ground beside the wire field.\n\nShe does not speak. She nods once—a minute, almost imperceptible movement of the death mask—and then steps back into the razor wire. The light intensifies, the sandalwood scent grows overwhelming, and the Saint, along with the bubbling, burning wreckage of the Mechanists, vanishes.\n\nYou are alone, injured but functional, clutching the Reliquary of the Saint of Gears, deep behind what were enemy lines. You look up and see the friendly signal flare—green and red—of The Anvil trench line. The mission is complete, but the cost was near-fatal, and the intervention was unholy.\n\n---\n\n## 📜 In-Lore Mission Report: The Relic Retrieval of Vesperia\n\n### **Agent:** Sister Agata, Stigmatic Nun, Gothic Cardinalate.\n### **Target Objective:** Retrieval of the Reliquary of the Saint of Gears.\n### **Operation Code:** 'Martyr's Grinder'\n### **Status:** **SUCCESS (BLESSED/COMPROMISED)**\n\n**Summary:** Sister Agata successfully infiltrated the enemy trench line known as 'The Grinder' and neutralized two Iron Sultanate Mechanists (one confirmed KIA, one critically disabled) before securing the target reliquary. Agent sustained critical injury during exfiltration through the wire fields, resulting in a near-total mission failure.\n\n**Divine/Heretical Intervention:** The agent confirms the manifestation of a figure matching the apocryphal description of the Butchered Saint. This entity intervened to neutralize pursuing Mechanist Enforcers, allowing the agent's escape and healing her injuries. The nature of this intervention is classified as **Theologically Compromised** and requires immediate examination by the High Confessors. The Agent is to be quarantined upon return.\n\n**Cost to Faith:** Agent Agata is functionally intact and the relic is secured, but her soul has been brushed by the impossible. Further action required to ascertain her purity. The mission is officially a success, though the price paid was not in blood, but in grace.\n\n***\n\n"
