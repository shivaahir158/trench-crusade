{"text": "[SYSTEM: SCENARIO START: THE ASHEN BASTION - Faction: Gothic Cardinalate. Character: Sister Hospitaller Thera. Objective: Reach the wounded **Black Guard Captain** located deep within the abandoned 'Ashen Bastion' to administer life-saving theological support and retrieve critical codes. Setting: A labyrinthine, burning underground command bunker recently assaulted by the **Iron Sultanate**. END SCENARIO]\n\nNarrator:\n\nSmoke chokes the narrow corridors of the Ashen Bastion. Sister Hospitaller Thera, your faith-forged armor is scorched, but your resolve is absolute. The Captain's vital signs are failing, and the codes he holds are paramount. You are confronted by a collapsed passage. Beyond the blockage, you hear the sharp, rhythmic gunfire of surviving **Iron Sultanate** drones searching the area. To your left, a barely stable ventilation shaft offers a hazardous shortcut.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Breach Wall:** Plant a quick-detonation charge on the collapsed wall to clear a path, risking alerting the drones.\n2.  **Ventilation Shaft:** Climb into the narrow, smoke-filled ventilation shaft, risking a collapse or becoming trapped.\n3.  **Silence and Wait:** Silence your systems and wait for the drone patrol to move past your location.\n\n[INST] 2 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 1**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Traversal/Stability): 1d6. Result: 2 (Minor Failure/Injury). Outcome: Traversal is difficult; the Sister takes a minor wound but avoids immediate collapse.]\n\nYou choose the hazardous shortcut. You force your way into the narrow, smoke-filled **Ventilation Shaft**. The metal is rusted and sharp. You make slow, agonizing progress, the confined space scraping painfully against your heavy armor. A sharp edge slices through the material near your wrist joint. You take a minor wound, but the structural integrity of the shaft holds for now.\n\nYou exit the shaft directly onto a wide, main corridor. The Captain's signal is directly ahead, approximately 40 meters. However, two **Iron Sultanate Light Drones** are scanning the corridor between you and your objective. They haven't spotted your exit yet. To your right, the main power conduit runs along the wall toward the Captain's position.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Conduit Overload:** Use a specialized tool to overload the main power conduit, hoping the resulting explosion disables the drones.\n2.  **Stealth Run:** Engage optical camouflage and sprint the 40 meters to the Captain's position, relying purely on speed.\n3.  **Covered Advance:** Use the large, fallen marble pillar nearby as cover, making a slower, tactical advance toward the drones.</s>\n\n[INST] 1 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 2**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Trap/Damage): 1d6. Result: 5 (Success). Outcome: Drones destroyed; the resulting explosion is massive and attracts immediate heavy response.]\n\nYou choose **Conduit Overload**. You quickly plant a plasma needle into the main power conduit. The resulting surge is immediate and violent. The conduit explodes in a shower of sparks and magnetic energy.\n\nThe two **Iron Sultanate Light Drones** are caught in the blast and instantly cease to function, crashing to the ground in smoking heaps. The path to the Captain is clear.\n\nHowever, the powerful explosion reverberates throughout the entire Ashen Bastion. Your internal systems register heavy structural damage, and you hear the unmistakable sound of **Iron Sultanate Heavy Infantry** deploying directly above your position\u2014likely preparing to rappel down into the corridor. You have seconds.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Secure Captain:** Immediately rush to the Captain and stabilize his condition before the enemy arrives.\n2.  **Set Defense:** Detach the heavy plasma pistol from the destroyed drones and set a crude booby trap near your position.\n3.  **Find Exit:** Ignore the Captain for a moment and desperately search for an alternative exit route from the corridor.</s>\n\n[INST] 1 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 3**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Medical/Time Limit): 1d6. Result: 4 (Success with Stress). Outcome: Captain stabilized and codes retrieved, just before the heavy infantry arrives.]\n\nYou choose **Secure Captain**. You ignore the sound of the approaching heavy infantry and sprint toward the Captain's position. He is slumped against a pile of broken furniture, his armor cracked and his life fluid leaking rapidly.\n\nYou administer the sacred stimulants and use your medical tools to stabilize his breathing and seal his largest wounds. The Captain's eyes flutter open. He manages to gasp the critical codes before succumbing to unconsciousness. Mission objective secured.\n\nAs you finish sealing the Captain's chest wound, the heavy infantry arrives. Three massive **Iron Sultanate Heavy Assault Frames** crash through the ceiling above, landing 15 meters from your position. They are armed with grinding kinetic weapons and look intent on total annihilation. They have spotted you.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Ignite the Corridor:** Use a flamer to create a wall of fire, buying precious seconds to drag the Captain away.\n2.  **Charge the Frames:** Engage the three heavy assault frames directly in melee combat with your Crozius (staff).\n3.  **Call for Support:** Use your comms to broadcast the recovered codes and call for an immediate extraction, risking a full counter-attack on your position.</s>\n\n[INST] 1 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 4**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Area Denial/Drag): 1d6. Result: 5 (Success). Outcome: Frames delayed; the Captain is moved to a safer position.]\n\nYou choose **Ignite the Corridor**. You unleash a massive burst from your integrated flamer, washing the corridor with a wall of sanctified fire. The heat and flame briefly deter the **Heavy Assault Frames**. \n\nYou use this precious window to grab the Captain's failing armor and drag him violently behind the remains of a heavy blast door located several meters away. The fire holds the Frames back for the moment, but you hear their kinetic weapons powering up. You are safe from immediate fire, but trapped with a dying Captain and three heavy enemies inbound. You must escape this corner.\n\nYour Turn (Player Action):\n\n1.  **Blast Door Lock:** Use an emergency welding tool to seal the blast door shut, trapping the frames in the fire but sealing yourself in the corner.\n2.  **Exit through Floor:** Plant an explosive charge on the floor to breach the lower levels, hoping to create an escape route.\n3.  **Engage Turret:** Use your bolter to target the weakest structural point on one of the Frames, attempting to cripple it before the fire burns down.</s>\n\n[INST] 2 [/INST]\n\n---\n\n**Game Turn 5**\n\n<s>Narrator:\n[SYSTEM: [ROLL LOG: Hidden Dice Roll (Escape/Destruction): 1d6. Result: 3 (Mixed Success/Loss). Outcome: Escape successful; however, the explosion kills the Captain, forcing the Sister to leave the body.]\n\nSurvival requires harsh choices. You choose to **Exit through Floor**. You plant a heavy explosive charge at your feet and retreat as far as possible behind the Captain's body.\n\nThe explosion is violent and focused downward. The floor tears open, revealing the dark, flooded service tunnels below. However, the force of the blast against the concrete wall is too much for the already heavily damaged Captain. The impact finally kills him.\n\nThe **Heavy Assault Frames** are briefly stunned by the new explosion. You have a chance to escape. You leap down the jagged hole into the dark, cold water of the lower levels, taking the recovered codes with you, but leaving the Captain's body behind. Mission objective secured, but with heavy loss.\n\n[SYSTEM: SCENARIO END]\n\n***\n\n## \u2705 In-Lore Mission Report: The Ashen Bastion\n\n### **Character & Faction:**\nSister Hospitaller Thera, Gothic Cardinalate.\n\n### **Mission Objective:**\nRetrieve critical codes from a wounded **Black Guard Captain**.\n\n### **Final Status:**\n**Mission Success (Objective Secured, Personnel Loss).**\n\n### **Summary of Action:**\nSister Hospitaller Thera chose a hazardous **Ventilation Shaft** to bypass the initial obstacle. She destroyed the covering **Iron Sultanate Light Drones** by overloading a **Conduit**. Upon the arrival of **Heavy Assault Frames**, she rushed to the Captain (**Secure Captain**), retrieved the codes, and used a **Flamer** to delay the enemy. She ultimately secured her escape and the codes by detonating the floor to access the service tunnels, which unfortunately killed the already fragile Captain.\n\n### **Outcome:**\nThe critical codes were successfully retrieved and transmitted back to Cardinalate Command. The Captain was lost, but the mission objective was met.\n\n### **Recommendations for the Cardinalate:**\n* The use of **Area Denial** (Flamer) proved vital for securing the objective under heavy assault.\n* Review extraction protocols for wounded personnel in structurally unsound environments.\n\n***\n"}
